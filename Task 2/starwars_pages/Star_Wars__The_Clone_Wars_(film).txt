It's unusual for an animated film, because it's not really like say
Beowulf
and it's not a Pixar movie, so it kind of falls in between in this funny world where
Star Wars
is, which is kind of hard-edged but not really, sort of on the verge of PG-13, flips over once in a while, but sort of the high end of PG.

STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS
A galaxy divided! Striking swiftly after
the Battle of Geonosis, Count Dooku's
droid army has seized control of the major
hyperspace lanes, separating the Republic
from the majority of its clone army. With
few clones available, the Jedi generals
cannot gain a foothold on the Outer Rim
as more and more planets choose to join
Dooku's Separatists. While the Jedi are
occupied fighting a war, no one is left to
keep the peace. Chaos and crime spread,
and the innocent become victims in a
lawless galaxy. Crime lord Jabba the
Hutt's son has been kidnapped by a rival
band of pirates. Desperate to save his son,
Jabba puts out a call for help—a call
the Jedi are cautious to answer…
Plot summary
[
]
The film begins with a narrator explaining the state of the
Clone Wars
. The Separatists control the majority of the
hyperlanes
, leaving Republic forces stranded in different parts of the
Outer Rim
. An
octopus-like craft
heads for
Tatooine
to capture
Jabba
the
Hutt
's son
Rotta
as part of a plan to make the Hutts join the
Clone Wars
.
Meanwhile, a fierce battle is taking place on the crystalline
planet
of
Christophsis
between the Republic's very limited
clone army
and the
Retail Caucus
forces. With the help of
Obi-Wan Kenobi
,
Anakin Skywalker
,
Rex
, and
Cody
, the clones steadily advance on the Separatists' forces, gaining the Republic an early victory. It doesn't last long, though, as the droid army under General
Loathsom
soon returns for more bloodshed. With no communications or the ability to fly in reinforcements, the fate of the few remaining clone soldiers are in the hands of Obi-Wan and Anakin. A shuttle soon comes with an important delivery; thinking it's reinforcements, the Jedi are suprised to find just a young
Padawan
named
Ahsoka Tano
, who insists that she has been sent by Master
Yoda
to serve as Anakin's Padawan.
The battle resumes, with
Separatist
forces advancing behind an expanding shield which the Republic's artillery is unable to penetrate. Tasked with taking down the
deflector
shield, Anakin and Ahsoka succeed in penetrating the enemy lines, using all their stealth, cunning and ability to improvise, while Obi-Wan stalls for time by holding a fake surrender negotiation with Loathsom.
Soon after the
final victory
for the Republic on
Christophsis
, Master Yoda arrives with the urgent message that a mysterious group of renegades has kidnapped Jabba's son, and it's up to Anakin, Ahsoka, Rex, and the clones to rescue him and bring him back home safely. Obi-Wan flies to
Tatooine
to assure Jabba that Rotta will be returned safely and to secure a promise by the Hutts to use their trading routes for safe passage within the
Outer Rim
.
After briefing in a Republic flagship, Anakin's forces descend through the clouds of the jungle planet of
Teth
for one of the many natural stone pillars which litter the landscape. Under heavy fire, Anakin, Ahsoka and Rex storm the
monastery
atop the pillar and find Rotta, who has gotten sick, only to be caught in an elaborate trap: Count
Dooku
has staged the kidnapping himself in order to blacklist the
Jedi
among the Hutts. First he has the Jedi retrieve the young
Hutt
to secure fake evidence and then
Asajj Ventress
, as the overseer of the operation, is charged with either retrieving or killing the young Huttlet.
While quarreling all the while about the proper procedure, yet slowly gaining respect of one another, Anakin and Ahsoka manage to escape the trap along with
R2-D2
and hijack a derelict
transport
, which they use to travel to Tatooine. Ahsoka uses medicine onboard to treat the sick Huttlet. Obi-Wan, alerted by Anakin, arrives just in time to relieve Rex and the rest of his forces and engages Ventress in combat where he manages to defeat her, though Ventress flees in the face of capture.
In the meantime,
Senator
Amidala
learns of Anakin's mission. Worried about him, she decides to contact Jabba's uncle,
Ziro the Hutt
, who lives in a shady part of
Coruscant
. The Hutt strangely refuses to cooperate, and soon Padmé finds out why: Ziro has actually conspired with Dooku to engineer the downfall of his nephew to seize the power over the Hutt clans for himself. Padmé is discovered and detained, but a chance call by
C-3PO
enables her to summon help, and Ziro is soon arrested by the
Coruscant Guard
.
Upon their arrival on Tatooine, Anakin and Ahsoka are attacked by
MagnaGuards
and shot down. Faced with a long way across desert sands and relentless opponents, Anakin devises a ruse; when Dooku corners Anakin, the pack he is carrying is revealed to contain merely rocks. Ahsoka and R2 travel with Rotta to Jabba's palace unmolested, but just as they near it, Ahsoka is ambushed by three MagnaGuards, whom she narrowly defeats. But as Anakin and Ahsoka enter the palace one after another, they are threatened with execution by Jabba's men even though Rotta is safely returned. Padmé calls just in time to convince Jabba of his uncle's duplicity, while Anakin and Ahsoka are triumphantly retrieved by Obi-Wan, Yoda, Cody and the clones. Dooku tells Sidious about his failure but Sidious tells Dooku that the tide of war still turned in their favor according with Sidious' master plan as Jabba allowed the Republic to use the Hutt Cartel hyperspace lanes.
Development
[
]
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
was designed to serve as both a stand-alone story and a lead-in to the weekly
animated TV series of the same name
.
[
7
]
George Lucas
had the idea for a film after viewing some of the already completed footage on the big screen.
[
5
]
Warner Bros.
had tracked the series' development from the beginning, and Lucas decided on a theatrical launch after viewing some footage,
[
8
]
and deciding, "This is so beautiful, why don't we just go and use the crew and make a feature?" Lucas described the film was "almost an afterthought."
[
9
]
Howard Roffman
, president of
Lucas Licensing
, said of the decision, "Sometimes George works in strange ways."
[
10
]
Producer
Catherine Winder
said the sudden decision added to an already large challenge of establishing a show "of this sophistication and complexity,"
[
11
]
but she felt it was a good way to start the series, and she felt budgetary constraints forced the production team to think outside the box in a positive way.
[
11
]
One of the film's main plot threads—the kidnapping of
Jabba the Hutt's son
—was inspired by the film
Shogun's Shadow
.
[
12
]
The main part of the film was composed of three episodes with similar titles originally meant to form a trilogy: "Castle of Deception," "Castle of Doom"
[
13
]
and "Castle of Salvation,"
[
14
]
while a standalone episode "The New Padawan," which was developed later in the production as a flashback episode during the series, became the opening sequence of the movie, eventually leading to the introduction of
Ahsoka Tano
.
[
15
]
Lucasfilm Animation
used
Autodesk
software
to animate the film. The
Maya
3D modeling
program was used to create highly detailed worlds, characters and creatures.
[
16
]
The film's animation style was designed to pay homage to the stylized looks of both
Japanese
anime
and
manga
, and the
supermarionation
of the
British
1960s
series
Thunderbirds
. At a
Cartoon Network
-hosted discussion, Lucas said did not want the
Clone Wars
film or television series to look like such movies as
Beowulf
because he wanted a stylized look rather than a realistic one, and he did not want it to look like the popular
Pixar
films, such as
The Incredibles
because he wanted the film and characters to have a unique style.
[
17
]
Lucas also decided to create the animated film and series from a live-action perspective, which Winder said set it apart from other CGI films because it "meant using long camera shots, aggressive lighting techniques, and relying on editing instead of storyboards."
[
11
]
Animators also reviewed designs from the
original 2003
Clone Wars
series
when creating the animation style for the film and the new series.
[
18
]
The film's music was composed by
Kevin Kiner
.
[
19
]
Steward Lee is a storyboard artist.
[
8
]
When it was decided to produce the film, Lucasfilm contacted all the major film
Star Wars
actors to see who was interested in voicing their characters for
The Clone Wars
.
[
20
]
In the end,
Anthony Daniels
,
Matthew Wood
,
Christopher Lee
and
Samuel L. Jackson
returned to voice their respective characters.
[
21
]
Several voice actors also reprised their roles from the
2003 series
.
Warner Bros. Animation,
Industrial Light & Magic
, Production I.G,
Polygon Pictures
, and CGCG contributed some animation for the film.

"
This is a breakthrough project -- returning Star Wars to the big screen in a completely new way while beginning an exciting new chapter in George Lucas' legendary saga. We immediately felt that it would be a fantastic theatrical event and are thrilled to be bringing it to moviegoers.
"
―Dan Fellman, Warner Bros. Pictures President of Domestic Distribution

At Hasbro's fall 2007 analyst event, it was announced that
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
would have a "theatrical launch" on
August 8
, 2008, with it beginning to be shown on TV during that fall.
[
22
]
Although Lucasfilm had previously announced that it would produce an animated feature film in 2008,
[
23
]
when initially asked for confirmation, an LFL representative replied that "It's one of the many things being discussed but we have no decisions yet. For us it's all about finding a creative way to launch a creative TV series."
[
24
]
At ToyFare 2008, a LEGO official announced that an animated feature film would be released in the UK in September 2008,
[
25
]
and would be made up of the first three episodes of the series, with regular episodes airing later on television on an at-the-time unrevealed channel.
[
26
]
It was officially announced on
February 12
, 2008 that the feature film would be released in theaters on
August 15
, 2008, with the TV series debuting in the fall.
[
3
]
Warner Bros. showed a preview of the film in Las Vegas, Nevada on March 13, 2008.
[
27
]
Lucas attended the event and held a question and answer session.
[
5
]
The first theatrical trailer debuted on May 8, 2008 on five separate
Turner Network
channels.
[
28
]
A second trailer was released in June 2008.
[
29
]
The film premiered at
Grauman's Egyptian Theatre
on
August 10
, 2008,
[
30
]
and was later screened on
August 14
, 2008 at
Los Angeles's
Nokia Theater
accompanying a Lucasfilm VIP party with special guests John Knoll and Dave Filoni. SpikeTV producer Terry Minogue speculated that his channel would debut the film on television at some point after its theatrical release.
[

The film had its US broadcast premiere on Cartoon Network on November 20, 2010.

Toys "R" Us
mounted digital clocks in all 585 of its stores that counted down to the release of the
Clone Wars
toys, and more than 225 of the stores opened at midnight for the debut of the
Star Wars
products. Two of the Toys "R" Us flagship outlets in
Mission Bay
,
San Diego
,
California
and
Times Square
in
Manhattan
,
New York City
held costume and trivia contests on July 26 and gave away limited-edition
Star Wars
toys with every purchase. A section of the Toys "R" Us
website
was also dedicated to
The Clone Wars
.
[
10
]
Due to the Lucas's sudden decision to make a
Clone Wars
film after viewing footage of the television show, Lucas Licensing did not have time to enter into agreements with previous
Star Wars
marketing partners like
Pepsi
,
Burger King
and
Kellogg's
, with which the
Lucasfilm
licensing company had a 10-year marketing plan for the other films; when questioned by
The New York Times
for a
Star Wars
merchandising in July 2006, a Pepsi spokesperson was unaware a new
Star Wars
film was even being released.
Target
and
KB Toys
also devoted shelf space for
Clone Wars
toys, but did not hold midnight releases or pursue the branding opportunities Toys "R" Us did. The
McDonald's
fast food restaurant
chain held its first ever
Happy Meal
promotion for a
Star Wars
movie starting on August 15. For four weeks, 18 exclusive toys came in specially designed Happy Meal boxes.
[

DK Publishing
and
Penguin Group
released tie-in books, activities and other merchandise, including
Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Visual Guide
(published by DK) and
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
(published by Puffin in the UK and by Grosset & Dunlap in the U.S). The publishers also released storybook, picture books and an activity book.

At the
American International Toy Fair
,
LEGO
announced a product line for the film and the TV series, to be released in July 2008 in the United States and August 2008 in the United Kingdom.
[
35
]
LucasArts
adapted the movie into
Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Jedi Alliance
for the
Nintendo DS
and
Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Lightsaber Duels
for
Wii
.
[
36
]
A reviewer from
PocketGamer.co.uk
said his expectations for
Jedi Alliance
were low due to poor
Clone Wars
movie reviews, but he found the game "a varied and well-paced experience."
[
37
]
Dark Horse Comics
published a six-issue digest-sized
comic book
mini-series
.
Randy Stradley
, vice president of publishing for Dark Horse, said the sudden decision to release the
Clone Wars
film required the company to temporarily delay plans for two other
Star Wars
comic book series,
Dark Times
and
Rebellion
. The
Clone Wars
comics did not receive the promotional campaign it otherwise would have due to the abruptness of the theatrical and comic book releases.
[
38
]
Topps
, the
trading cards
company, released a series of 90
Clone Wars
cards on July 26, which also included foil cards, motion cards, animation cel cards and rare sketch cards by top
Star Wars
artists and Lucasfilm animators.

A
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
open wheel car
for the
IndyCar Series
was unveiled at the 2008 San Diego
Comic-Con International
. The #26 car, which also included
Blockbuster Inc.
decals and was driven by
Andretti Green Racing
driver
Marco Andretti
, ran
August 24
on the
Infineon Raceway
in the
Sonoma Mountains
in California; Andretti said, "I'm hoping that my upcoming battle at Infineon will be as exciting as anything in a
Star Wars
movie so I can win it for both Blockbuster and Lucasfilm."
[
42
]
The car finished 14th at Infineon, which Andretti attributed to a slow
pit stop
early in the race; he added, "I just don't think it was a very good performance for us today."
[

The
Clone Wars
car was the second collaboration between Lucasfilm, Blockbuster and Andretti Green Racing, which premiered an

"
As a fan of 'Star Wars' for so long, I always knew there would be debate. No matter what you do with 'Star Wars,' you're going to have a huge debate about it. I actually think its part of the fun of being a fan; having the big arguments over 'I like this' and 'I didn't like that' or 'this aspect fit with what I thought' but 'this aspect didn't.' I think one of the greatest things is that people are still talking about 'Star Wars.' 'Anakin has a Padawan? I've never heard of that before?' But now everybody is talking about the fact that Anakin has a Padawan and the movie introduced that idea.

Dan Fellman, head of distribution for Warner Bros.
