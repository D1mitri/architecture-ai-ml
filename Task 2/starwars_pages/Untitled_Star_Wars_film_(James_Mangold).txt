I thought about a biblical epic, like a Ten Commandments and the dawning of the Force. Where did the Force come from? When did we discover it? When did we know how to use it? And a story just started developing.

Origins
[
]
In the early
1970s
,
Star Wars
creator
George Lucas
once envisioned the
Star Wars
saga
consisting of nine films, the first which would focus on the origins of the
Jedi Knights
and how they were initiated and trained.
Original trilogy
producer
Gary Kurtz
was briefed about Lucas' plans, but by
1980
, Lucas changed his mind and decided to wrap up the series with the
1983
film
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Jedi
, much to Kurtz's dismay as he revealed to
TheForce.net
in light of the prequel trilogy's mixed beginning with the
1999
film
Star Wars
: Episode I
The Phantom Menace
.
[

]
Published between
2012
and
2014
, the
Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi
comic
series by
John Ostrander
and
Jan Duursema
explored the origins of the
Je'daii
in the
Star Wars
Legends
continuity.

On
February 6
,
2018
,
Game of Thrones
showrunners
David Benioff
and
D.B. Weiss
were announced by
StarWars.com
to produce and write a
Star Wars
film series
,
[

]
which reportedly focused on the time period in which the
Jedi
came to exist.
[
7
]
Benioff and Weiss reluctantly walked away from their project on
October 28
,
2019
due to scheduling conflicts with
Netflix
despite their plans for a
2022
release after a hiatus following
Star Wars
: Episode IX
The Rise of Skywalker
.
Lucasfilm
president
Kathleen Kennedy
confirmed her interest in waiting for the duo to return at some point.
[

]
At some point around 2019,
David S. Goyer
was signed on to write a film regarding the Jedi's origins 25,000
years
before
The Phantom Menace
, alongside a
separate project
under director
Guillermo del Toro
. However, Goyer left his work for Lucasfilm and the latter project became shelved.

Pre-production
[
]
After the Disney purchase of Lucasfilm, filmmaker
James Mangold
was attached to making a
Boba Fett
film in the style of
Sergio Leone
.
This project
eventually morphed into the series
Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett
.
[

]
Mangold was then hired by Lucasfilm to direct and co-write
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
, the final
Indiana Jones
film. On
April 7
,
2023
, it was confirmed during
Celebration Europe
that Mangold would direct a
Star Wars
film centered on the origins of the Jedi.
[

]
After the panel, Mangold revealed to the
Variety
magazine that his film would take place during the dawn of the Jedi and flesh out the exact origins of
The Force
, like how it was formed and discovered by the
first Jedi
. Having been drawn at the prospect of making a
Star Wars
film in the vein of a
religious
epic
like
Cecil B. DeMille's
1956
film
The Ten Commandments
or
William Wyler's
1959
film
Ben-Hur
, Mangold discussed these references with Kennedy to convince her of the potential to explore the concept of the Force due to having evolved into a "kind of religious legend" due to encompassing across the
Star Wars
saga.
[

]
A
The Hollywood Reporter
article stated that the title of the film is
Dawn of the Jedi
.
[
11
]
On
February 27
,
2025
, Lucasfilm president
Kathleen Kennedy
revealed to
Deadline
that Mangold was currently working on a script, and was delayed by directing
A Complete Unknown
and awards season due to the film's success.
