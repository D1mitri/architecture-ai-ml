When developing
Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures
, the first
Star Wars
series created for preschoolers, the creative team never stopped thinking about how this show may be a youngling's first step into a
larger world
, and their first time experiencing the limitless potential of the
Star Wars
galaxy. The show's characters, tone, and the life lessons woven throughout each episode were written just for them, and our talented team was committed to honoring the cinematic legacy while staying true to the expectations of parents for the youngest of audiences.

Production
[

"
I'm going for something a little more specific because this is for children. So, it's got to be clear what's being said. It's almost like with a pre-lingual child or even a dog, where there's a specific intent with the whining or vocalization. If you're a parent, you can often read what that is. And that's kind of what you want with a character like Nubs.
"
―Dee Bradley Baker describing how he voiced his character Nubs

Younglings design exploration by
Betsy Bauer
Young Jedi Adventures
was produced by Lucasfilm in collaboration with
Wild Canary
,
[

as well as
ICON Creative Studio
[

for Disney+, Disney Junior, and Disney Channel. The series' executive producers included
James Waugh
,
Jacqui Lopez

Josh Rimes

served as co-producer and supervising director. Other producers included
Jeannine Hodson

Lamont Magee

[

Actors recorded their lines for the series' episodes remotely, with screenwriters and directors stitching the disparate voice performances together. During an interview with
StarWars.com
,
Dee Bradley Baker
likened his character Nubs, who doesn't speak
Galactic Basic Standard
(English), to a pre-lingual child or even a dog. Baker recorded multiple options for his characters' lines. Nubs' friends Kai Brightstar and Lys Solay also reinforced what their friend was saying during dialogues, with Baker likening their relationship to that between
Han Solo
and
Chewbacca
. Due to the show's pre-school target audience, sub-titles for Nubs was ruled out by the showrunners.
