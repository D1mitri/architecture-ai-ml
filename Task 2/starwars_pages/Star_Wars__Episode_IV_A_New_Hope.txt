Plot summary
Assault on
Tantive IV
Nineteen
years
after the
formation
of the
Galactic Empire
,
the galaxy
is in a state of
civil war
. The
Rebel Alliance
has won their first major victory by
stealing
plans
to the Galactic Empire's secret weapon, the
Death Star
. Hoping that the stolen plans can save her
people
and restore freedom to the galaxy,
Princess
Leia Organa
, who is in custody of the plans, attempts to race home aboard the
Tantive IV
. However, her ship is intercepted by the
Imperial
I
-class
Star Destroyer
Devastator
over the
desert
planet
of
Tatooine
.
Princess Leia is kidnapped by the Galactic Empire.
The ship is captured, and several Imperial
stormtroopers
come aboard. After defeating the small number of
guards
defending the ship, the
Sith Lord
Darth Vader
arrives to assess the damage. Vader is outraged and questions
Captain Antilles
, whom he eventually strangles and kills. Hiding on the ship, Princess Leia is able to record a
holographic
message with the help of
R2-D2
, and gives the
droid
the plans for the Death Star and the responsibility of taking the message to
Obi-Wan Kenobi
, a Jedi-in-hiding on Tatooine. Leia is spotted by stormtroopers and they shoot her with a stun blast and bring her before Vader. Leia claims she and the ship's crew were on a diplomatic mission to
Alderaan
, but is disbelieved by Vader, who denounces her as a traitor and has her taken prisoner. Vader orders a message be sent to the
Imperial Senate
, informing them that the ship was destroyed, with everyone on board killed. R2-D2 and
C-3PO
use an escape pod in order to escape the ship and reach the planet of Tatooine below, narrowly escaping destruction by an Imperial cannon when the operators do not detect the droids in the pod.
Luke's destiny
Luke Skywalker receives his father's lightsaber.
"
There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
"
―Luke Skywalker
[

]
After arguing and going their separate ways for a while, the droids are individually picked up by
Jawa
traders and brought aboard a
sandcrawler
. They are later bought by moisture farmer
Owen Lars
and his nephew,
Luke Skywalker
, a young farmer who lost his parents as a baby and hopes to one day be a starfighter pilot just like his friends. While cleaning R2, Luke discovers a short portion of the hologram. At the mention of Obi Wan, he wonders if she means his neighbor Ben Kenobi.
While eating dinner with Owen and his Aunt
Beru Whitesun Lars
, Owen asks Luke to take R2 to
Anchorhead
the next day to have his memory wiped, and expresses his hope Luke will stay with them for one more harvest season before applying to the
Academy
. R2 escapes from the Lars' homestead in search of Obi-Wan, whom the droid claims to be the property of. Luke and C-3PO search the desert and find R2 the next day, only to be attacked by
sand people
. Luke and his droids are rescued by Ben Kenobi, who confirms he is Obi-Wan.
At his home, Obi-Wan gives Luke his father's
lightsaber
, as Obi-Wan recalls his own friendship with Luke's father. He tells Luke that he and his father were a part of the
Jedi
order that once protected the galaxy before the Empire took over and that Darth Vader was once his apprentice before he fell to the
dark side of the Force
and murdered Luke's father. After viewing Princess Leia's full recording, Obi-Wan attempts to persuade Luke to accompany him to Alderaan. Luke refuses but agrees to take Obi-Wan as far as Anchorhead. On the way, the group discovers the remains of the sandcrawler, the Jawas having been killed by stormtroopers searching for the droids. With dawning horror, Luke hurries home only to find it burning and his aunt and uncle's charred remains, both brutally murdered by the same stormtroopers.
Luke returns upset, but Obi-Wan tells him there was nothing he could do, and that he would have been killed too and the plans would be in possession of the Empire. With nothing keeping him on Tatooine, Luke, Obi Wan, and the two droids travel to
Mos Eisley
to find passage to Alderaan, Princess Leia's home planet.
Aboard the Death Star,
Cassio Tagge
argues with
Conan Antonio Motti
about the stations vulnerability to the rebels and points out that the rebellion has been gaining support within the imperial senate.
Wilhuff Tarkin
enters the room with Darth Vader and informs them that the
Emperor
has dissolved the senate completely, sweeping away the last remnant of the Old Republic. Believing fear will keep the galaxy in line, Motti boasts the power of the Death Star, to which Vader replies that its power is insignificant compared to
the Force
. When Motti mocks Vader's belief in the Force, Vader
Force chokes
him until Tarkin orders him to stop, and expresses his own desire to crush the Rebellion.
Back in Mos Eisley, Luke, Obi-Wan and the droids run into a patrol of stormtroopers, who ask for their identification. Obi-Wan uses a
Jedi mind trick
on the lead trooper, who lets them pass. Arriving at
Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina
, the group hires
smuggler
Han Solo
and his
First Mate
, a
Wookiee
named
Chewbacca
, for 17,000
credits
, 2,000 in advance and 15,000 upon arrival, to take the four of them to Alderaan aboard their ship, the
Millennium Falcon
. Han has a brief run-in with
Greedo
over his debts to crime lord
Jabba the Hutt
, which ends with Han fatally
shooting
Greedo. Jabba later confronts Han in the
Falcon
's docking bay, scolding him for killing Greedo. Han defends the actions that offended Jabba (dumping a load of cargo when confronted by an Imperial patrol) and promises he'll pay the gangster what he owes. Luke, Ben and the droids arrive at the
Falcon
's hangar. A brief scuffle with stormtroopers ensues, and the
Falcon
escapes Imperial Star Destroyers over Tatooine and sets a course to Alderaan, unaware that the Death Star has just arrived there as well.
Rescue of the princess
"
Here's where the fun begins!
"
―Han Solo
[

]
Leia, having resisted being tortured with a
mind probe
for the location of the Rebel Alliance's headquarters, is brought before
Grand Moff
Tarkin
. Tarkin threatens to use the Death Star's
superlaser
on Leia's
homeworld
of Alderaan if she does not tell them the Rebel base's location. She reluctantly tells them the base is on
Dantooine
, but Tarkin orders Alderaan to be destroyed anyway for its role in supporting the rebels.
Aboard the Millennium Falcon, Obi-Wan feels a
great disturbance in the Force
while Luke undergoes Lightsaber training with a
training remote
. Upon dropping out of
hyperspace
, they find what seems to be an
asteroid field
in Alderaan's place. The
Millennium Falcon
is then pulled aboard the Death Star by its powerful
tractor beam
.
Heroes en route to the Death Star
Tarkin and Vader discover that Leia lied about the Rebel base's location when their forces only discover the ruins of a base on Dantooine. Tarkin orders her to be executed.
Having docked with the Death Star, Solo and the others ambush two stormtroopers and the Imperial scanning crew sent to investigate the Falcon by hiding in hidden smuggling compartments. With Han and Luke now disguised as the two stormtroopers, the group storms a control room to figure out how to escape. Obi-Wan separates from the group to disable the tractor beam, leaving the others alone. While connected to the Imperial Network, R2-D2 discovers Princess Leia is aboard the station and is set for termination. Luke convinces Han and Chewbacca to
rescue her
with the vague promise of a grand reward. Han and Chewbacca reluctantly agree. Luke plans to march into
Detention Block AA-23
, claiming that Chewbacca is part of a prisoner transfer. C-3PO and R2-D2 are instructed to remain behind, and the trio sets off on their rescue attempt. Upon being met with suspicion, they are quick to subdue the officers and guards in the princess's cell block. Luke frees Leia from her cell, but the group are pinned down by a squad of stormtroopers. Leia takes charge, blasting a hole in a nearby grate and jumping through while Chewbacca, Luke, and Han all dive after the princess.
The chute ends up leading to a
garbage compactor
that is also home to a
resident
dianoga
. Soon after landing, the creature pulls Luke under the surface, but releases him and is scared away when the Imperials realize where the heroes escaped to and activate the compactor. As the walls close in on the foursome, Luke desperately calls to C-3PO over his comlink asking for the compactor to be shut down. Leia struggles to get to the top and Chewbacca tries to unlock the door. R2-D2 manages to shut down the compactor just in time, although, amidst the muffled cries of joy over the comlink, C-3PO is briefly convinced that his master and friends have been crushed.
After escaping from the trash compactor, the group hurries back to the
Millennium Falcon
, hoping that Obi-Wan has successfully shut down the tractor beam. Leia and Han bicker about who is in charge of the mission, while Han muses no reward is worth dealing with Leia's scathing criticism. Luke and Leia briefly become separated from Han and Chewie when Han chases after a group of stormtroopers, only to run into a whole battalion and be chased by them instead. Luke and Leia nearly run into a large chasm and are forced to swing across with a
grappling hook
amongst blaster fire, with Leia giving Luke a brief kiss "for luck". The group soon reunite and make their way back to the
Falcon
.
Sacrifice and victory
"You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."
"
This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi. It will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
"
―Darth Vader
[

]
Meanwhile, Obi-Wan, remaining completely undetected, shuts down the tractor beam. Vader, however, had sensed his presence through the Force, and, while Obi-Wan makes his way to the
Millennium Falcon
, confronts his old master and engages him in a lightsaber duel. Luke and the others make it back to the Falcon, where Luke and several stormtroopers witness the battle. Sparing one last glance at Luke, Obi-Wan allows himself to be struck down by Vader, thus becoming one with the Force and allowing Luke and the others to escape. Horrified and angered at having witnessed Obi-Wan's demise at the hands of Vader, Luke and the others are forced to flee on the
Millennium Falcon
under a hail of blaster fire from the stormtroopers.
Still mourning Obi-Wan's death, Luke helps Solo fend off a squadron of
TIE fighters
. Despite their supposed victory, Leia correctly believes the Empire let them go in order to track them to the rebel base. The crew of the
Falcon
finally meets the Rebel Alliance on the moon of
Yavin 4
, and the information in R2-D2 is turned over to them.
General
Dodonna
plans the attack on the Death Star, as the plans reveal a weakness in the Death Stars design in the form of a thermal exhaust port leading to the station's reactor. Believing a direct hit with
proton torpedos
will cause a chain reaction that will destroy the station, Dodanna orders the pilots to man their ships in preparation for the battle. To Luke's dismay, Han leaves after receiving his reward to settle his debts.
Rebel fighters approach the Death Star.
The Rebel strike force begins its attack on the Death Star, as the battle station approaches Yavin 4. A group of
X-wing
, and
Y-wing starfighters
, Luke among them, assault a trench on the Death Star's surface to hit the station's vulnerable spot before it can destroy the Alliance's base. During this, most of the Rebel craft, including Luke's friend
Biggs Darklighter
, are picked off by a group of Imperial fighters led by Darth Vader. Tarkin is told by an Imperial officer that the Rebels do pose a danger, but Tarkin refuses to evacuate in their supposed moment of triumph. With the Death Star only minutes from being in range to destroy Yavin 4, Luke makes one last run down the trench toward the exhaust port. Just as Vader opens fire on Luke from his personal
TIE Advanced x1
, Han returns in the
Millennium Falcon
and attacks the Imperials, resulting in Vader's TIE getting knocked out of the trench. Luke, aided by the voice of Kenobi and guided by the Force, accurately fires two proton torpedoes into the exhaust port and retreats. Moments later the battle station explodes, killing Tarkin and everyone on board, while Vader escapes into space.
The few remaining ships (those of
Wedge Antilles
, Luke, Han, and a
Y-wing Pilot
) return to Yavin 4 and a
victory ceremony
commences, where
medals
are presented to the heroes, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, by Princess Leia, as the rebels give them a standing ovation.
Development
Conception
During post-production on his previous film,
American Graffiti
, Lucas repeatedly discussed the concept of a "
space opera
" with producer
Gary Kurtz
. In January 1973 Lucas began work on this, and by May had prepared a
14-page story outline
for distribution among film studios.
[
5
]
He had originally envisioned the film as being a continuation of both
American Graffiti
and '
'Apocalypse Now
(the latter of which he helped make before
Warner Bros. Studios
shut down his studio of
American Zoetrope
and thus forced him to hand over development to his compatriot, Francis Ford Coppola). His note for the basic plotline for the film, which was intended to be a response to the Vietnam War era, was that it involved "a
technological empire
going after a
small band of freedom fighters
."
[
6
]
[
7
]
According to Walter Murch, a former associate of Lucas when the latter was filming
Apocalypse Now
, the space opera setting was conceived in large part because, due to the Vietnam War still going on, the audiences would not have been receptive to a direct attack on American involvement in Vietnam.
[
8
]
[
9
]
Because of its
outer space
setting, the story was viewed as science fiction, an unpopular genre at the box office. Lucas later proposed that terms like "space fantasy" or "science fantasy" better fit the story.
[
5
]
He brought the outline to
Universal Studios
and
United Artists
; both rejected the project (the former refused directly, while the latter withheld their answer until after the 10 day wait period ended).
[
6
]
[
10
]
[
7
]
He also turned to
Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures
, though they also turned him down.
[
6
]
[
7
]
Lucas disliked the studio system because his previous two films,
American Graffiti
and
THX 1138
, had been re-edited without his consent.
[
11
]
Still, aware that studios were unavoidable, he pursued
Alan Ladd, Jr.
, the head of
20th Century Fox
. Although Ladd did not grasp the technical side of the project, he believed that Lucas was talented. Lucas later stated that Ladd "invested in me, [but] he did not invest in the movie."
[
5
]
Production
Lucas wrote multiple drafts of the script: a
rough draft
in May and a
first draft
in July 1974, a second draft titled,
Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars
in January and a third titled,
The Star Wars: From The Adventures of Luke Starkiller
in August 1975.
As the draft developed, the characters evolved significantly. Early in development, Luke Skywalker's character changed from a 60-year-old general to a member of a family of
dwarfs
;
[
5
]
[
12
]
the
Corellian
smuggler,
Han Solo
, was envisioned as a large, green-skinned monster with gills.
[
12
]
Chewbacca
was inspired by Lucas' Alaskan malamute dog, Indiana, who often acted as the director's "co-pilot" by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.
[
12
]
The Force, a mysterious energy field, was initially conceived as the
Kyber crystal
, a "galactic holy grail."
[
13
]
[
5
]
The completed script was too long for one movie; however, Lucas refused to condense it. Instead, he expanded the first third of it into one movie and left the rest for two future films, effectively creating the
original
Star Wars
trilogy
.
[
14
]
[
5
]
[
15
]
Lucas hired conceptual artist
Ralph McQuarrie
to create paintings of certain scenes during screenwriting. When Lucas delivered his screenplay to the studio, he included several of McQuarrie's paintings.
[
16
]
20th Century Fox approved a budget of $8,250,000;
American Graffiti
'
s positive reviews allowed Lucas to renegotiate his deal with Alan Ladd, Jr. and request the sequel rights to the film. For Lucas, this deal protected
Star Wars
'
unwritten segments and most of the merchandising profits.

In 1975, Lucas founded the visual effects company
Industrial Light & Magic
(ILM) after discovering that 20th Century Fox's visual effects department had been disbanded. ILM began its work on
Star Wars
in a warehouse in
Van Nuys, California
. Lucas himself bought old equipment for pennies on the dollar.

traditionally, models were filmed by moving them in front of a stationary camera.
[
19
]
Most of the visual effects used
motion control photography
, which creates the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras called the
Dykstraflex
.
[
18
]
all the models would be shot in front of a blue screen, which would allow the placement of other elements into the scene, this process is called optical compositing.
[
18
]
the team the special effects team retooled an optical printer that allowed separate film strips to be photographed and combined onto a single layer of film.
[
18
]
artists created matt paintings to increase the scope and production value of a scene, by extending environments painted on glass, that would be photographed and combined with live-action elements.
[
18
]
Model spaceships were constructed on the basis of drawings by
Joe Johnston
, input from Lucas, and paintings by McQuarrie. Lucas opted to abandon the traditional sleekness of science fiction by creating a "used universe" in which all devices, ships, and buildings looked aged and dirty.

Filming began on
March 22
,
1976
in the
Tunisia
.
[
22
]
Lucas fell behind schedule in the first week of shooting due to a rare Tunisian rainstorm, malfunctioning props, and electronic breakdowns.
[
23
]
When actor
Anthony Daniels
wore the C-3PO outfit for the first time, the left leg piece shattered down through the plastic covering his left foot, stabbing him. After completing filming in Tunisia, production moved into the more controlled environment of
Elstree Studios
, near London.
[
23
]
However, significant problems, such as a
crew
that had little interest in the film, still arose.
[
5
]
[
23
]
Most of the crew considered the project a "children's film," rarely took their work seriously, and often found it unintentionally humorous.
[
24
]
Actor
Kenny Baker
later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure.
[
25
]
Harrison Ford
found the dialogue difficult, saying, "You can type this shit, George, but you sure can't say it."
[
26
]
Lucas clashed with
director of photography
Gilbert Taylor
, whom producer Gary Kurtz called "old-school" and "crotchety."
[
5
]
[
27
]
Moreover, with a background in independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself. His camera suggestions were rejected by an offended Taylor, who felt that Lucas was over-stepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions. Lucas eventually became frustrated that the costumes, sets and other elements were not living up to his original vision of
Star Wars
. He rarely spoke to the actors, who felt that he expected too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words "faster" and "more intense."
[
5
]
Ladd offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio; he dealt with scrutiny from
board
members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts. After production fell two weeks behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas that he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production. The crew split into three units, led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor
Robert Watts
, respectively. Under the new system, the project met the studio's deadline.
[
5
]
[
23
]
ILM concluded shooting on
April 22
, 1977 with shot 110P, that of a Star Destroyer.
[
28
]
Star Wars
was originally slated for release in
Christmas
1976; however, delays pushed the film's release to summer 1977. Already anxious about meeting his deadline, Lucas was shocked when his editor's first cut of the film was a "complete disaster." After attempting to persuade the original editor to cut the film his way, Lucas replaced the editor with
Paul Hirsch
and
Richard Chew
. He also allowed his then-wife
Marcia Lucas
to aid the editing process while she was cutting the film
New York, New York
with Lucas' friend
Martin Scorsese
. Richard Chew found the film had an non-energetic pace; it had been cut in a by-the-book manner: scenes were played out in
master shots
that flowed into
close-up
coverage. He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts. Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously; whoever finished first moved on to the next.
[

]
During production, the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile as he often appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level.
[
5
]
[
23
]
Post-production
was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century Fox. Moreover,
Mark Hamill
's face was injured in a car accident, which made reshoots impossible.
[
23
]
Meanwhile, ILM was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects. The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.
[
23
]
Moreover, theories surfaced that the workers at ILM lacked discipline, forcing Lucas to intervene frequently to ensure that they were on schedule.
[
5
]
With hundreds of uncompleted shots remaining, ILM was forced to finish a year's work in six months. Lucas inspired ILM by editing together aerial
dogfights
from old war films, which enhanced the pacing of the scenes.
[
5
]
[
19
]
During the chaos of production and post-production, the team made decisions about character voicing and
sound effects
. Sound designer
Ben Burtt
had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an "organic soundtrack." For Chewbacca's growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers, and walruses to create phrases and sentences. Burtt created the robotic voice of R2-D2 by filtering his voice through an electronic synthesizer. Darth Vader's breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a
scuba
tank implanted with a microphone.
[
29
]
Lucas never intended to use the voice of
David Prowse
, who portrayed Darth Vader in costume, because of Prowse's thick English
West Country
accent. He originally wanted
Orson Welles
to speak for Darth Vader. However, he felt that Welles' voice would be too recognizable, so he cast the lesser-known
James Earl Jones
.
[
30
]
Nor did Lucas intend to use Anthony Daniels' voice for C-3PO. Thirty well-established voice actors, such as
Stan Freberg
, read for the voice of the droid. According to Daniels, one of the major voice actors recommended Daniels' voice for the role.

The "Lost Cut" of
Star Wars
was edited by
John Jympson
.
[

When Lucas screened an early cut of the film for his friends, among them directors
Brian De Palma
,
John Milius
and
Steven Spielberg
, their reactions were disappointing. Spielberg, who claimed to have been the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film,

believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects. Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film. In contrast, Alan Ladd, Jr. and the rest of 20th Century Fox loved the film; one of the executives, Gareth Wigan, told Lucas, "This is the greatest film I've ever seen," and cried during the screening. Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding, having never gained any approval from studio executives before.

Although the delays increased the budget from $8 million to $11 million, the film was still the least expensive of the
Star Wars
saga.
Music
From the very beginning, Lucas' intention for "Star Wars" was that it would have very familiar sounding music, that despite the extraordinary visuals and events occurring onscreen, the music would be reminiscent of Earth and of the past. To that end, he originally wanted to fill the film with tracked classical music from various composers, in a similar fashion to
2001: A Space Odyssey
.
[
32
]
Lucas' friend,
Steven Spielberg
, recommended composer
John Williams
to Lucas after their recent collaboration on
Jaws
(1975). Spielberg convinced Lucas that he should meet with the composer, who in turn convinced him of the need for original music.
[
33
]
They also decided in this early meeting that the score should have a romantic musical sound, with leitmotifs for different characters and events, similar to the operas of
Richard Wagner
.
[
34
]
Rough cuts of "Star Wars" used something called a "temp score", referring to musical material that was there to find a rhythm while editing but would not be kept in the final cut as it would be replaced by the final score. These temp tracks would help to inspire the direction John Williams was to take with his score as he began writing it.
[
35
]
Most of the temp tracks are not public knowledge, but some information has been revealed over the years. In one interview, editor
Paul Hirsch
confirmed that a cue from
Bernard Herrmann
's
Psycho
score containing the famous "3-note motif" was used to temp the scene where the heroes exit the smuggling chambers of the Millennium Falcon.
[
36
]
In another interview, Hirsch revealed that the opening to "The Sacrifice" from
Igor Stravinsky
's "
The Rite of Spring
" was used to temp the scene in the desert, the Jawa scenes were temped from other parts of the same piece, and the Main Title crawl was temped with the overture of
Ivanhoe
by
Miklós Rózsa
.
[
37
]
Later, in his own book, Hirsch would claim that the Main Title crawl was temped with
Erich Korngold
's theme to 1938's
The Adventures of Robin Hood
. It is unknown which of these claims is correct. Also in his book, Hirsch mentions that the Cantina scene was tracked by Benny Goodman's "Avalon" from his Carnegie Hall performance, some of the early battle footage was tracked with "Dance of the Adolescents" from "The Rite of Spring", and the approach to the Death Star was temped with the music from the approach to Kong Island from Max Steiner's King Kong score.
[
38
]
In an interview, sound editor Ben Burtt said that Antonín Dvořák's New World Symphony was temped into the medal ceremony (Hirsch mentioned this in his book too), and parts of Anton Bruckner's Ninth Symphony were temped as Luke's theme.
[
37
]
Homages to many of these known temp tracks appear in the final score. For example, the cue [1m5-2m1] Desert Song from
Star Wars
is extremely similar to the opening of the Stravinsky piece it was temped with. Further, the music in [1m2] Main Title that plays when the underbelly of the Star Destroyer flies over the camera is very similar to the ending of "Mars - The Bringer of War" from
Holst
's "
The Planets
". Even the 3-note motif from
Psycho
appears in the very opening of the Star Wars cue [7m1-7m2 New] The Hatch Opens, exactly where the temp track would have been.
On January 10, 1977, Williams was invited to the spotting sessions, where he watched a rough cut of the film with Lucas, music supervisor
Lionel Newman
, music editor
Ken Wannberg
, producer
Gary Kurtz
, and film editor Paul Hirsch.
[
37
]
[

[

]
Over the next several weeks, he would get to work writing the score. The way Williams wrote his score, he began by creating all the various leitmotifs and character themes (such as "
Luke's Theme
," "
Leia's theme
," and "
Ben's theme
," the "
Jawa theme
," the "
Rebel Fanfare
," and the "
Imperial motif
"). He then went on to create the
actual score
by stringing all the themes he created together in a way that would match up with what was happening on screen.
[
40
]
It was unknown exactly how long John Williams spent writing the score, but it is certain that he would have had at the absolute most no more than 8 weeks, given that they started recording on March 5th. This is unrealistic because there needed to have been time for the orchestrators to write out all the various parts for the players, so it is more likely that the score was completed in 7 weeks or less.
As with any creative process, parts of the score went through multiple revisions. One well-known example is the cue "Lost R2", which scores the famous "binary sunset" scene. This scene was originally scored with a very different sounding piece that contained "Luke's theme". When Lucas heard the cue, he asked if it could be rescored with "Ben's theme" because he felt it fit the scene better.
[
35
]
It can be argued that this opened the door for "Ben's theme" to be recontextualized into what we think of today as the "Force theme". Another interesting example of the score changing was the cue "A Home Destroyed". When this cue was written, it was designed to score the end of Ben's house, Leia's torture, the discovery of the attacked sandcrawler, and Luke returning home to find his guardians dead and his home burned. While Williams was writing the score, the film was re-edited so that the board room scene would occur where the torture scene used to be. This caused the cue to be split in half. The first 14 bars were recorded by themselves with a newly written ending featuring the "Death Star theme" for the transition to the boardroom scene. Then a second cue was recorded, being made up of bars 31-71 (attacked sandcrawler and burned homestead scenes) and bars 17-30 (Leia torture scene), with some new transition material written to join them.
[
41
]
This isn't the only time editing of the film would require changes to the score, but it is one of the only examples where a re-edit resulted in the score being changed before it was recorded. The rest of the edits were done too late, and the remaining score changes were left to be made artificially by Ken Wannberg.
[
38
]
After the writing of the score was completed, the orchestrations were performed by lead orchestrator Herbert Spencer, who was assisted by Arthur Morton, Angela Morley, Al Woodbury, Alexander Courage and Williams himself.

When it came time to record the score, Williams was given no choice but to record in London, presumably due to budget constraints and the fact that most of the film was shot in England.
[
37
]
He did have the choice of which orchestra he wanted to work with, and he ended up choosing the
London Symphony Orchestra
(LSO) due to its primary conductor being his friend André Previn. This was historically significant, as it was the first time Williams ever got to work with an organized symphony orchestra for a film.
[
35
]
Previous films of his usually recorded with freelance players. The score was recorded over the course of eight days between March 5th and March 16th of 1977 at Anvil Recording Studios in Denham, England.
[
34
]
[
35
]
People present at the sessions included John Williams himself, who was conducting, George Lucas, recording engineer Eric Tomlinson, his assistant Alan Snelling, and music editor Ken Wannberg. The orchestra itself was made up of 26 violins, 10 violas, 10 cellos, 6 basses, 11 woodwinds, 8 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, 2 tubas, 2 harps, 3 percussion, 1 timpani, 1 piano, and 1 celeste.
[
45
]
The score was recorded with approximately 23 microphones, placed at strategic positions around the orchestra. The mixing console, a Rupert Neve, had 24 inputs and 16 outputs. Recording engineer Eric Tomlinson used the console to create a live LCR (Left, Center, Right) mix while the orchestra was playing. The live mixes were recorded straight to two 35mm magnetic film recorders (with healthy Dolby A noise reduction applied). The live mix was also routed to tracks 1-3 of a Struder A80 16-track 2 inch recorder, with sections of the orchestra isolated on tracks 4-15 and a 50 hz pilot tone on track 16. The pilot tone could later be used for synchronization with the film during editing.
[
46
]
[
47
]
After the recording was completed, the best takes were combined into performance edits by music editor Ken Wannberg. He created performance edits using one of the 35mm mag recordings, as well as with the 16 track tapes. (note: a performance edit is where sections of different takes are combined together to create the best possible recording of a given cue) The 16 track tapes were intended both for backup purposes, and to be sent off to be remixed by John Neal for the eventual soundtrack release on LP. The 35mm edits would of course be further edited by Wannberg into the final stems for use in the film.

Interestingly, for the film stem, the master tapes of a stereo version of this cue could not be located in time. The cue was instead sourced directly from the 4-track film stems to River of No Return. That is why this cue is noticeably much lower quality in the film vs on subsequent soundtrack releases.

Sound
A New Hope
was originally presented in monaural sound in many theaters, though the first-run
70mm
prints were some of the earliest wide-release examples of surround sound—something not seen in the commercial cinema since the
Cinerama
and
Cinemascope
experiments of the early 1950s.
Sources and inspirations
The film drew inspiration from a number of sources. This was conscious and has been acknowledged by George Lucas in interviews. It is characteristic of much myth-building.
Lucas has stated that Akira Kurosawa's
1958
film
The Hidden Fortress
(USA release
1962
) was a strong influence. The resemblance between the two buffoon farmers in
The Hidden Fortress
and the two talkative droids in
A New Hope
is apparent. Indeed, when the droids find themselves alone on Tatooine, even the music and the style of "wipe" cuts are a clear homage to
Hidden Fortress
. When
Motti
is criticizing
Darth Vader
, he is about to mention the Rebels' "hidden fortress" before Vader cuts him off in the middle of the last word.
The climactic scene in which the Death Star is assaulted was modeled after (including some of the same dialogue) the 1950s film
The Dam Busters
, in which
RAF
Lancaster bombers
fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim "
bouncing bombs
" at German man-made dams in a bid to cripple the heavy industry of the
Ruhr
. (
A New Hope
cinematographer
Gilbert Taylor
had previously worked on the special-effects sequences for that film.)
Lucas has made mention of the film
633 Squadron
directed by
Walter Grauman
when citing movies that inspired themes or elements in
A New Hope
. The "trench run" in
A New Hope
wherein Luke flies his X-wing through a "trench" on the Death Star and destroys the ship was inspired, at least in small part, by the finale of 633 Squadron, which involves several Royal Air Force planes flying at low level up a fjord against heavy, ground-based anti-aircraft fire, to attack a factory located at the base of a cliff at the canyon's end.
Release and reception
Star Wars
debuted on May 25, 1977 in 32 theaters, and proceeded to break house records, effectively becoming one of the first
blockbuster
films.
[
50
]
It remains one of the most financially successful films of all time. Some of the cast and crew noted lines of people stretching around theaters as they drove by. Even technical crew members, such as model makers, were asked for autographs, and cast members became instant household names.
[

]
The film's original total U.S. gross came to $307,263,857, and it earned $6,806,951 during its first weekend in wide release. Lucas claimed that he had spent most of the release day in a sound studio in Los Angeles. When he went out for lunch with his then-wife Marcia, they encountered a long queue of people along the sidewalks leading to Mann's Chinese Theater, waiting to see
Star Wars
.
[
23
]
The film became the highest-grossing film of 1977 and the highest-grossing film of all time until
E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial
broke that record in 1982. (With subsequent re-releases,
Star Wars
reclaimed the title, but lost it again to
James Cameron's
1997 blockbuster
Titanic
.) The film earned $797,900,000 worldwide, making it the first film to reach the $300 million mark.
[
51
]
Adjusted for inflation it is the second highest grossing movie of all time in the United States, behind
Gone with the Wind
.
[
52
]
In 1989, the U.S.
National Film Registry
of the
Library of Congress
selected the film as a "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important" film.
[
53

In 2006, Lucas' original screenplay was selected by the
Writers Guild of America
as the 68th greatest of all time.

The
American Film Institute
(or AFI) listed it 15th on a list of the top 100 films of the 20th century.

Originally, if the film did poorly at the box office, Lucas planned to turn the novel
Splinter of the Mind's Eye
into a low-budget sequel to the movie. According to an interview with Alan Dean Foster in
Empire
magazine, the book was written to be filmed as a low-budget sequel if
Star Wars
was not a huge success. Harrison Ford was not signed for the sequel as of the writing of the book, which is why Han Solo does not appear in the novel. However, with the success of
A New Hope
, Lucas was free to make
The Empire Strikes Back
.
[

]
Wary that
Star Wars
would be beaten out by other summer films, such as
Smokey and the Bandit
, 20th Century Fox moved the release date to Wednesday before
Memorial Day
:
May 25
,
1977
. However, few theaters ordered the film to be shown. In response, 20th Century Fox demanded that theaters order
Star Wars
if they wanted an eagerly anticipated film based on a best-selling novel titled
The Other Side of Midnight
.
[

]
The New York Times
published the first advertisements for the film on
May 15
, only ten days before its premiere.
[
68
]
Star Wars
became an instant success upon release; within three weeks, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. Before 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37,000,000; in 1977, the company earned $79,000,000. Although the film's cultural neutrality helped it to gain international success, Ladd became anxious during the premiere in
Japan
. After the screening, the audience was silent, leading Ladd, Jr. to fear that the film would be unsuccessful. He was later told that, in Japan, silence was the greatest honor to a film. Meanwhile, thousands attended a ceremony at
Grauman's Chinese Theater
, where C-3PO, R2-D2 and Darth Vader placed their footprints in the theater's forecourt.

During the film's original theatrical run, there were a number of television promotions:

Adaptations and tie-in media
Charles Lippincott
was hired by Lucas' production company,
Lucasfilm
, as marketing director for
Star Wars
. Because 20th Century Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and posters, Lippincott was forced to look elsewhere. He secured deals with
Stan Lee
,
Roy Thomas
and
Marvel Comics
for a comic book adaptation and with
Del Rey
Books for a novelization. Although
Star Wars
merchandise was available to enthusiastic children upon release, only
Kenner Toys
—who believed that the film would be unsuccessful—had accepted Lippincott's licensing offers. Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its "empty box" Christmas campaign; these vouchers could be redeemed for
the toys
in March 1978.
[
5
]
The
novelization
of the film was published in December 1976, six months before the film was released. The credited author was George Lucas, but the book was revealed to have been
ghostwritten
by
Alan Dean Foster
, who later wrote the first
Expanded Universe
novel,
Splinter of the Mind's Eye
. The book was first published as
Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker
; later editions were titled simply
Star Wars
and, later,
Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope
, to reflect the retitling of the film. Certain scenes deleted from the film (and later restored or archived in DVD bonus features) were present in the novel, such as Luke at Tosche Station with Biggs and the encounter between Han and Jabba in
Docking Bay 94
. Other deleted scenes from the movie, such as a close-up of a stormtrooper riding on a
Dewback
, were included in a photo insert added to later printings of the book. Smaller details were also changed; for example, in the Death Star assault, Luke's callsign is Blue Five instead of Red Five as in the film. Lippincott secured the deal with Del Rey Books to publish the novelization in November 1976. By February 1977, a half million copies had been sold.
[

]
A
radio drama
adaptation of the film was written by
Brian Daley
, directed by
John Madden
, and produced for and broadcast on the American
National Public Radio
network in 1981. The adaptation received cooperation from
George Lucas
, who donated the rights to NPR. John Williams' music and Ben Burtt's sound design were retained for the show; Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) reprised their roles as well. The radio drama featured scenes not seen in the final cut of the film, such as Luke Skywalker's observation of the space battle above Tatooine through binoculars, a skyhopper race, and Darth Vader's interrogation of Princess Leia. In terms of
Star Wars
canon
, the radio drama is given the highest designation, G-canon.
[

]
Over the years, several comic adaptations of the film have been produced:
Marvel Comics
launched their Star Wars series with a six-part adaptation of the film written by
Roy Thomas
and illustrated by
Howard Chaykin
.
In 1978,
Al Williamson
worked on an adaptation in comic strip form that was never released.
Concurrently with the release of the 1997 Special Edition,
Dark Horse Comics
released a new
four-part adaptation
written by
Bruce Jones
and illustrated by
Eduardo Barreto
.
A
manga adaptation
illustrated by
Hisao Tamaki
was released in Japan in 1997 and in the United States in 1998.
Re-releases
The film was originally released as—and consequently often called—
Star Wars
, without
Episode IV
or the subtitle
A New Hope
. The 1980 sequel,
Star Wars
: Episode V
The Empire Strikes Back
, featured the episode number and subtitle in the opening crawl. When the original film was re-released on
April 10
, 1981,
Episode IV: A New Hope
was added above the original opening crawl.
[
73
]
Although Lucas claims that only six films were ever planned, representatives of Lucasfilm discussed plans for nine or 12 possible films in early interviews.
[
74
]
The film was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1997.

As part of
Star Wars
'
20th anniversary celebration in 1997,
A New Hope
was digitally remastered and re-released to theaters, along with
The Empire Strikes Back
and
Return of the Jedi
, under the campaign title
The Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition
. The Special Edition versions contained visual shots and scenes that were unachievable in the original release due to financial, technological, and time restraints; one such scene involved a meeting between Han Solo and
Jabba the Hutt
.
[

Although most changes were minor or cosmetic in nature, some fans believe that Lucas degraded the movie with the additions.
[
75

For instance, a controversial change in which Greedo shoots first when confronting Han Solo has inspired T-shirts brandishing the phrase "
Han shot first
."

anamorphic

[
79

Despite The Walt Disney Company's
2012
purchase of Lucasfilm and the release rights to all future
Star Wars
films, Fox was to retain original distribution rights to
A New Hope
, which they co-produced and co-financed, in perpetuity in all media worldwide. Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home video rights worldwide for the franchise's five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through
May
2020
, at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney. This complex relationship between Fox and Disney, particularly in regards to Fox's perpetual rights to Episode IV, was to create an obstacle for any future boxed set comprising all nine films.

Deleted scenes
‡
There are many short alternate takes throughout
Star Wars
where Luke appears in his poncho: Luke in the desert, in the Tusken Raiders' canyon, Luke finding the destroyed homestead, and in the hangar on
Yavin 4
. The only poncho scenes that made the final cut were in
Docking Bay 94
, on the
Millennium Falcon
flight from the Death Star, and on arrival on Yavin 4.
Aunt Beru's Blue Milk
Beru
is in the homestead, pouring a
blue liquid
into a jug.
Luke in the Desert
Luke with his
macrobinoculars
Luke Skywalker
is in the Tatooine desert repairing a
moisture vaporator
, assisted by a
Treadwell
droid, when he notices shining objects in the sky. With his macrobinoculars Luke sees two ships engaged in combat beyond the atmosphere. He jumps into his
landspeeder
. The malfunctioning Treadwell blows a fuse and is unable to follow. Luke speeds off into the desert to find his friends. The scene originally occurred after the
Tantive IV
is boarded, just before Darth Vader's first appearance in the film. It is thought that there is no longer any clear footage of this scene available. Existing footage has been degraded by poor film storage conditions over the years. Before the film was cut, this was the audience's first sight of the young Luke Skywalker, much earlier than in the final cut. It was removed along with subsequent scenes of Luke and his friends in
Anchorhead
. George Lucas had originally written the scenes and shot them at the suggestion of his industry friends who thought that audiences wouldn't understand the story strictly being told from a droid's point of view. Upon realizing that the story was really about the droids' adventures and it was them leading things to Luke and Obi-Wan, etc. Lucas took the footage out.
Tosche Station
Luke's landspeeder races into the town of Anchorhead, nearly running over an old woman. Luke rushes into
Tosche Station
excitedly telling his friends about the battle above their planet. He is overjoyed to be reunited with his friend
Biggs Darklighter
who is on planet leave from the Academy.
Deak
,
Windy
,
Camie
,
Fixer
and Biggs all follow Luke outside to see the battle with Luke's macrobinoculars. The battle appears to have ended and Luke's friends ridicule him for making it all up. This scene was to come just after R2-D2 and C-3PO eject from the
Tantive IV
in an escape pod, and before the scene where
Princess
Leia
is led captive before Darth Vader. This scene establishes Luke's difficult relationships with his peers, and gives a picture of life on Tatooine. Storyline pacing may have been the deciding factor, but it should also be borne in mind that after Lucas's first screening of the rough cut of
Star Wars
in 1977, a fellow filmmaker jokingly accused him of producing "
American Graffiti
in space." This jibe probably influenced Lucas to cut the scenes set in Anchorhead. The sequence where Luke nearly runs down an old woman was an effects shot that was never completed.
Luke and Biggs
Luke says farewell to Biggs
This scene is a conversation between Luke and his oldest friend, Biggs Darklighter. Biggs has left Tatooine and is on planet leave from the
Imperial Academy
where he is training to be a space pilot. Luke's envy of Biggs's success conflicts with his duty to his uncle and his reasons for remaining on Tatooine. Biggs quietly tells Luke that he has decided to join the Rebellion against the Empire. In a tense and emotional conversation, the two young men say their final farewells. This scene was to come in between the scene where C-3PO spots a distant Jawa sandcrawler in the desert, and the capture of R2-D2 by the Jawas in the canyon. The Luke and Biggs sequence was part of the whole Anchorhead backstory on Tatooine, and was cut along with the other early scenes on Tatooine, probably for reasons of story pacing.
Vader and Chief Bast
In this short scene, Darth Vader and Chief
Bast
walk along a corridor on the Death Star. Bast reports that the search for the missing droids has extended to Mos Eisley spaceport. Vader observes that Princess Leia is resisting interrogation, and Bast boldly criticizes
Tarkin
's plan to break her as "foolish." The scene would have appeared between the scene where Han Solo encounters Jabba the Hutt in
Docking Bay 94
(also cut), and the scene where Luke and Ben find the
Millennium Falcon
in Docking Bay 94.
The Search for R2
C-3PO pilots the landspeeder
R2-D2 has absconded from his new master, Luke Skywalker. Early in the morning, Luke and Threepio rush off in the landspeeder to search for R2, with Threepio driving the landspeeder. They talk about Artoo, Ben Kenobi, and how angry Uncle Owen is going to be. The scene belongs at the start of the sequence where Luke and 3PO search for R2, before the attack of the
Tusken Raiders
. The moment was scored with a light version of Luke's theme; the music can be heard at the beginning of the cue "Land of the Sand People" on the original LP and CD configurations, or "Landspeeder Search" in the Special Edition album. Before the days of CGI, scenes like this landspeeder cockpit sequence had to be filmed against a rear-projection screen. The scene was dropped due to poor quality.
Stormtrooper Search
Various alien creatures are seen walking around a narrow street in Mos Eisley, and some Stormtroopers walk past.
Darth Vader widens the Search
This is a scene with Darth Vader and another Imperial officer on the
Death Star
.
