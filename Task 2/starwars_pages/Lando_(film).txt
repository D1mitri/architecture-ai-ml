In an interview published earlier the same day, Simien had told
The Hollywood Reporter
that he was "still attached, I think" to the series. He stated he had been told the higher ups "loved" what he wrote, but they had needed to halt production as they worked on availability. However, he did ponder if he had been quietly fired, asking "Am I too Black? Am I too queer? And people just don't want to say that?"

Lando
was not an "easy yes," and that he had done so due to liking the characters and his children's love for
Star Wars
. He also stated that he felt the degree of creative control that he had allowed for a more "singular" vision for the film, which he believed would make it more desirable for audiences.
