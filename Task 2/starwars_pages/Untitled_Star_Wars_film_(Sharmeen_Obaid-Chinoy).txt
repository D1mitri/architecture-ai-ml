Well, we're 15 years out from
Rise of Skywalker
, so we're post-war, post-First Order, and the Jedi are in disarray. And, there's a lot of discussion around, 'Who are the Jedi? What are they doing? What's the state of the galaxy?' And, [Rey]'s attempting to rebuild the Jedi Order, based on the books, based on what she promised Luke, so that's where we're going.

Development
[
]
Background
[
]
The
scavenger
-turned-
Jedi
Rey was portrayed by actress
Daisy Ridley
over the course of the
Star Wars
sequel trilogy
. These films—
2015
's
Star Wars
: Episode VII
The Force Awakens
,
[

]
2017
's
Star Wars
: Episode VIII
The Last Jedi
,
[

]
and
2019
's
Star Wars
: Episode IX
The Rise of Skywalker
—see Rey grow from a scavenger unsure of her place in the
galaxy
into the last hope of the Jedi Order,
[

]
culminating in her
destroying
the resurrected
Galactic Emperor
and her paternal grandfather, the
Sith Lord
Darth Sidious
, while the
Resistance
and people of the galaxy
overthrow
the tyrannical
First Order
.
[
9
]
As established by the
2020
reference book
The Star Wars Book
by
Pablo Hidalgo
, Rey became a Jedi Master sometime after the events of
The Rise of Skywalker
and worked to restore galactic peace while holding that title.
[
10
]
Ridley, however, expressed apprehension with returning to the role of Rey, telling
Variety
in 2019 that
The Rise of Skywalker
was "a great close." She said she was unsure if it was "possible" to craft a story "extraordinary" enough to convince her to return.
[
11
]
Around the same time, Ridley reiterated in an interview to
Screen Rant
that
The Rise of Skywalker
felt like the end of her
Star Wars
journey. Furthermore, Ridley stated that any hypothetical return would also need to feature Rey's comrades
Finn
[
12
]
—a
Force-sensitive
First Order stormtrooper
-turned-
Resistance
general
played by
John Boyega
—and
Poe Dameron
,
[
12
]
the
Oscar Isaac
-portrayed
Resistance pilot
who also served as a general in the Resistance.
[
9
]
Ridley also suggested that
[
12
]
series newcomer
Jannah
, another former stormtrooper who joined the Resistance and was played by
Naomi Ackie
,
[
9
]
should appear in Rey's hypothetical return.
[
12
]
In an interview with
Empire
magazine published in
November
,
2021
,
Lucasfilm
President
Kathleen Kennedy
teased the return of Rey, Finn and Poe Dameron by saying they were "not characters we're going to forget" and that there were "conversations" amongst the Lucasfilm creative team about where to take them next.
[

Initial reports
[
]
Reports, entering the creatives
[
]
On
March 14
,
2022
,
The Ankler
reported that
Damon Lindelof
was working as a writer on a new
Star Wars
film.
[
14
]
On
May 26
, while at
Celebration Anaheim
, Kennedy confirmed that future films in the
Star Wars
franchise would take place after the events of the sequel trilogy, saying "[the sequel era] is what we talk a lot about in terms of where we're going with our movies, and just how far out from that we'll go. That's very much the space we're concentrating on."
[
15
]
On
October 23
,
Deadline
reported that
Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy
had boarded the project to direct Lindelof's script.
[
16
]
Obaid-Chinoy would later state that she was attracted to the story because of the
hero's journey
, a storytelling style that she felt was central to
Star Wars
and fit naturally into the questions around rebuilding the Jedi.
[
17
]
She also believed that Rey was at the center of the
Star Wars
universe and, reflecting on her decision to direct, expressed an interest in building "the next adventure" that came after the sequel trilogy.
[
18
]
The next day, on
October 24
,
The Hollywood Reporter
reported that
Justin Britt-Gibson
joined Lindelof as a co-writer on the project after Lucasfilm held a "secret writers room" for two weeks in
July
with various creative figures present. The report also claimed that the project would be set after the events of
Star Wars
: Episode IX
The Rise of Skywalker
.
[
19
]
On
March 22
, 2023,
Variety
reported that Lindelof and Britt-Gibson departed the project a month prior in
February
and that
Steven Knight
was hired to rewrite the story.
[
20
]
On
April 18
, Lindelof officially commented on his departure from the project, saying that for him, the project was a "true labor of love." He also wished the film's creative team the best of luck.
[
21
]
On
April 28
, Lindelof elaborated, stating he worked extensively on the project and was then asked to leave.
[
22
]
Enter Daisy Ridley
[
]
In that time, several rumors floated about an upcoming Rey project, with even Ridley hearing rumors of a story about an older Rey being in development. However, Ridley herself thought she would only return in ten years or more after
The Rise of Skywalker
'
s release.
[
23
]
On
December 2
,
2022
,
[
24
]
during a day off shooting her film
Magpie
,
[
25
]
Ridley visited Lucasfilm headquarters for
[
24
]
a breakfast
[
25
]
or lunch
[
24
]
meeting with Kathleen Kennedy. Ridley denied on social media that the meeting was for any future projects,
[
24
]
but later admitted in a
November
2023
Hollywood Reporter
interview that she had been offered a role in the film at that meeting.
[
26
]
All the same, Ridley at first had thought the meeting would, indeed, simply be a breakfast, as she and Kennedy had enjoyed meals together in the past without any business involved. Ridley even told a personal friend, who asked if the meeting would involve a new Rey project, that she did not believe such a story would be discussed.
[
25
]
Instead, much to Ridley's surprise,
[
25
]
Kennedy would pitch the film during the meeting,
[
27
]
revealing its development to her
[
25
]
and asking Ridley if she was interested in returning.
[
26
]
After thinking over the idea,
[
27
]
as part of her feared it was too soon to return,
[
23
]
and learning of the planned story, Ridley decided the film was something she wanted to do.
[
27
]
Before agreeing, Ridley sought advice from her mother and husband about returning.
[
23
]
She later reflected that returning was not "a difficult decision," yet it was also not something she agreed to right away. Kennedy gave her as much time as she needed to decide.
[
28
]
By the time she told Lucasfilm she would return for the film, she had fallen in love with its story.
[
29
]
Official reveal
[
]
"
When we did the announcement last year, it was really, my agent flew over and honestly, I came off and we were all really emotional. Of course, I always feel lucky to be part of it, but it was like a reminder I suppose of, sorry I'm just gabbling, but I suppose a reminder of how people do feel about Rey. I was like, "It's wonderful." It's wonderful to be part of something that people love and to play a character that people... It's so weird. It's really making me emotional thinking about it. I get to have more adventures. I'm like, "Where is she now? What is this new adventure and how are things going to go?" That's a long way of saying it's great. It's really great.
"
―Daisy Ridley reflects on the reveal
[

Daisy Ridley and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy announcing the project at Celebration Europe
At
Celebration Europe
on
April 7
, 2023, much of the priorly reported information was officially confirmed by Lucasfilm. Alongside the announcement of two other films, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy was officially confirmed as director and the project was confirmed to take place after the events of
The Rise of Skywalker.
Furthermore, Daisy Ridley was formally announced to be reprising her role as Rey Skywalker in the film and appeared on-stage.
[
1
]
According to Kathleen Kennedy, who was—as noticed by
Variety
writers Amon Warmann and William Earl—"keen" to discuss the film,
[
31
]
asking Ridley to attend the panel in person had been "a pretty straightforward phone call."
[
32
]
In an interview after the panel with
Yahoo
, Kennedy confirmed that the film had been in development for several years and that Steven Knight was writing the current iteration of the script, which was due to be handed in within six weeks.
[
33
]
The positive response to her return warmed Ridley's heart, made her emotional,
[
30
]
and helped prepare her for the film after a period of feeling overwhelmed.
[
29
]
Immediately after the panel, in an interview with
IGN
, Kennedy confirmed the film would be set fifteen years after the events of
The Rise of Skywalker
and would explore the post-war, post-First Order world of
the
Star Wars
Galaxy
, during which time the Jedi Order was in disarray as Rey attempts to rebuild it. Furthermore, Kennedy revealed the people of the galaxy would be questioning who exactly the Jedi even were as Rey tried to rebuild the Order based on its texts and her promise to
[
4
]
her own mentor,
[
9
]
Luke Skywalker
.
[
4
]
With the announcement, Obaid-Chinoy made note of her interest in the hero's journey as something she could reflect in the film.
[
17
]
On
April 13
,
This Week! in Star Wars
repeated that the film would take place fifteen years after
The Rise of Skywalker
.
[
3
]
On
April 20
, Obaid-Chinoy revealed that the film would be the next
Star Wars
film to release.
[
34
]
Star Wars Insider
then teased in
issue 219
that the film would entail rising powers that wanted to destroy the new Jedi.
[
6
]
On
November 21
, in an interview with
Collider
, Daisy Ridley commented that she thought the story for the film was "really cool" and that the film was not what she expected, but she is nonetheless very excited to work on the film. Ridley also revealed that she was not approached for a part in the film until after February 2023.
[
35
]
Expressing excitement an interview with
CNN
on
December 31
, Chinoy stated that the film was going to be "very special." She further noted how she felt it was "about time" a female director had the chance "to shape the story in a galaxy far, far away."

2024: January to March
[
]
"
I know a script is happening, and I'm going to be reading it imminently, which is very exciting.
"
―Daisy Ridley, circa March 2024
[
37
]
As of
January
2024
, as established on
January 16
, Lucasfilm confirmed the film was still in development and that they were waiting on the latest draft from Steven Knight.
[
38
]
Indeed, Ridley herself stated in a
January 12
-published interview that she was happy to return to the
Star Wars
universe, describing the forthcoming film as a fantastic exploration and cool continuation of the universe.
[
27
]
She further remarked in an interview with
Variety
, published on
January 24
, that Sharmeen had given her a rundown of the entire story, which had helped convince her to join the project in the first place; according to Ridley, Sharmeen's idea was "cool as shit" and "worthwhile." When asked how Sharmeen's status as the first female
Star Wars
director would change the series, Ridley answered that she did not know the answer, but that she was excited to work with someone whose documentaries and story pitch she loved. She further noted that she did not know "what or who is who" in the film when asked a question in regards to her sequel trilogy co-stars
Adam Driver
, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac,
[
39
]
who played the fallen-and-then-redeemed Jedi
Ben Solo
, Finn, and Dameron, respectively.
[
9
]
As noted by Inverse in a
January 25th
article, Ridley also did not rule out returning to
Star Wars
once again in a hypothetical sequel.
[
40
]
In an interview published on
January 29
, Ridley affirmed to interviewer Josh Horowitz that she would not have returned if she did not like the story presented to her. She stated the film had a fun direction and reflected that she would be finding herself as an experienced
Star Wars
actor on set, instead of being one of the newer crowd, as she was in the sequel trilogy.
[
23
]
Ridley talked about the positive emotions she felt returning to
Star Wars
with
Collider
on January 31, 2024.
[
30
]
In a subsequent interview with
Collider
published on
March 9
, by which point rumors had circulated that the film would be titled "
New Jedi Order
," Ridley affirmed that she was unfamiliar with that title but revealed that a script would be finished shortly. She stated she was excited to read that script in the near future. She was further hopeful that filming would start that year but noted that the
2023 Writers Guild of America strike
had delayed the timeline.
[
37
]
A
March 10
-published interview with
Deadline
saw Ridley repeat that she was still waiting to read a script and that she knew "bits and bobs" of the story, including that it would introduce new characters. However, she ruled out the idea of Rey having children, or at least any likely possibility of that, due to her understanding of the
Jedi Code
. Furthermore, she stated she did not know if any other existing characters would appear, specifically saying she did not know if
[
41
]
the deceased
[
9
]
Ben Solo would appear in some form.
[
41
]
Driver himself in 2024, however, said he has no intention of returning to the
Star Wars
franchise
[
42
]
and revealed in
2025
he had pitched a film of his own in
The Hunt for Ben Solo
, only for that project to be shot down by Disney.
[
43
]
In a
March 11
, 2024, interview with
Den of Geek
, in which Ridley did not respond to the film's title being "
New Jedi Order
" when the interviewer called it the "tentative title," Ridley stated that she was excited to explore Rey as a teacher and revealed Rey would act differently as a master than her own mentor,
Luke Skywalker
. She also reflected on how strange it was to return to
Star Wars
after her work in other films since
The Rise of Skywalker
.
[
44
]
In another March 11 interview, this discussion with
Screen Rant
, Ridley said that she would love to see Finn return in the film as a Jedi, but admitted such a decision would be "above [her] pay grade" and was not a choice that was up to her.
[
45
]
That
May
, Ridley repeated her desire to see Finn appear in the film, stating "it feels like" Finn should be involved.
[
46
]
While Boyega has criticized his treatment within the sequel trilogy, he had also noted an opening to return to the series by that time, saying as such in 2023. While in that 2023 interview he said he was open to all possibilities,
[
47
]
Boyega had suggested in 2019 that he would only return in a hypothetical film if Isaac and Ridley were also involved. Isaac, for his part, said in 2019 that
The Rise of Skywalker
felt like "closing of a chapter of my life."
[
11
]
In
2025
, Isaac would outright deny that he would appear in the film when asked by a fan.
[
48
]
2024: April to October
[
]
"
Maybe you've heard. I'm all the Jedi.
[…]
I've studied the sacred texts of the Jedi. Do you know what the most important pages are? It's the blank ones left at the end. Because those ancient teachers knew those lessons weren't finished and never could be.
[…]
Ben was right about letting go of the past. But not about killing it. My task is to make something new. Not by killing the past, but by building on all that's good in it.
"
―Rey Skywalker, as quoted in a 2024 Holocron
[
49
]
In an interview with
Empire
magazine published on
April 8
, Ridley affirmed that she was ready to return to the role of Rey, stating that she felt like she's was "owning" the role as "an adult." In that interview, she affirmed she knew the film's story beats and revealed she was preparing to read a script, stating that she was "curious about it all." She also reflected on the joy she felt for the sequel films and how, if she had not been excited for the upcoming film, she would not have returned.
[
28
]
Around
May
of that year, a new
Holocron
was released at
Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge
that featured a post-
Rise of Skywalker
Rey reflecting on her place in the galaxy, which became the latest "story" for Rey in the
Star Wars
timeline as of that moment. The Holocron saw Rey affirm her place as a Skywalker and her efforts to build something new out of the good of the past Jedi Order.
[
49
]
In
June
, Ridley visited the Disneyland park, where she saw her own appearance as a holographic Rey in
Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance
and then encountered an actress playing Rey in
Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge
. The encounter with "herself" was surreal to Ridley, but she also reflected in a later interview with
The Hollywood Reporter
that "it was really joyful" and increased her excitement to return to Rey herself.
[
50
]
In a
June 10
-released interview, Ridley also touched on the "exciting" future before her, stating that the new creatives involved—writer Knight and director Obaid-Chinoy—would give the film a new feel compared to prior
Star Wars
outings. She stated she would be reading a script "soonish" and, when asked if she would do another trilogy, replied was only doing one film "for now."
[
25
]
Director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy (pictured) outlined an interest in introducing a new cast of characters while also paying respect to the characters of past creatives.
Also published that June, Obaid-Chinoy had an interview with
SiriusXM
in which she touched on the Rey film, with the director reflecting on how all involved wanted take the time to tell a good story for Ridley's character. To Obaid-Chinoy, the task before her was creating an adventure that would follow up her journey in the sequel trilogy. Obaid-Chinoy stated that the story would see Rey enter a life involving a Jedi academy. Further, Obaid-Chinoy revealed had spoken to
Star Wars
creator
George Lucas
,
[
18
]
sequel trilogy director
[
9
]
J.J. Abrams
, and major
Star Wars
creative
Dave Filoni
, whom she continued to consult with on a regular basis. Further, she mentioned Kennedy,
Carrie Beck
, and
Simon Emanuel
as major figures behind the project. It was Obaid-Chinoy's hope to respect pre-existing characters like Rey and to also introduce a new cast for the next generation of fans to latch onto.
[

]
Enter George Nolfi
[
]
"
The way I approach it is, you look at what's come before you, you look at the broad ideas of what they want to do. Meaning: Lucasfilm, Disney, Sharmeen [Obaid-Chinoy], the director, and then you do what a writer does, and try to try and put beats of a story together. Try and imagine characters, and then you present that with an understanding that it needs to honour, obviously, a long, incredible tradition.
"
―George Nolfi
[
2
]
In an interview with
The Hollywood Reporter
published on
October 25
, but held before that date by the article's own admission, Ridley shared her story about Disneyland and her own fears about returning to Rey, noting how much had changed for her since she had last inhabited the role. However, she also said that created a sense of excitement in her.
[
50
]
However, in that same month,
October
of 2024,
Puck News
and
Variety
reported that Steven Knight had exited the project,
[
51
]
with
Deadline
further reporting Lucasfilm was actively searching for new writers.
[
52
]
Nonetheless, Ridley stated on an October 25th episode of the
Happy Sad Confused
podcast that news about the film was imminent, even hinting that she had already seen something about its next stages.
[
53
]
Her interview with
The Hollywood Reporter
in which she shared her Disneyland story and excitement about returning was also published on October 25th.
[
50
]
Ridley told
USA Today
on
November 4
that Rey's future was exciting and forthcoming.
[
54
]
On
January 24
, 2025,
The Hollywood Reporter
reported that
George Nolfi
had joined the film as the fourth writer attached to the project,
[
55
]
and Ridley responded by posting the article's title to her Instagram page.
[
56
]
Nolfi confirmed his involvement on the film on
February 3
in an interview with
Film Stories
.
[
2
]
On
February 14
, an interview between Ridley and
The Hollywood Reporter
was published, in which Ridley stated the film's script was being given freedom and time to be the best possible version of its story. She urged fans that the wait for the film would be worth it. She also praised Nolfi as a writer and noted she was excited to read his script.
[
57
]
In another interview with
Collider
, published earlier on
February 10
, Ridley revealed she had "been very involved" in the film in a somewhat hands-on capacity, having become more involved as the years passed. Aware of what was happening behind the scenes, including with the script and the film's story, she promised the film had the best crew and actors possible and was reaching "the absolute best place to tell this particular story."
[
58
]
On
March 10
,
The Direct
published an interview with Ridley within which
The Direct
described the film as a project that had seen delays. As rumors had been circulating that Kennedy would step down from her position within Lucasfilm, Ridley affirmed that, as she understood things, Kennedy was "very involved" in the Rey film. She also stated she did not know when the film would begin filming when asked.
[
59
]
Celebration 2025 and beyond
[
]
"
It made sense to expand the franchise in that way. I'm just looking forward, first of all seeing if it's real, because sometimes we have had a few Star Wars announcements. You know development is development, you can't always get it done. I'm just hoping that Daisy gets that chance to shine in a franchise that's finally hers, where she is now the bona fide Jedi, I think is exciting, and I can't wait to watch it. I really can't. I'm happy for her.
"
―John Boyega, Daisy Ridley's sequel trilogy costar
[
60
]
At
Star Wars
Celebration Japan
, Kennedy and Filoni promised that Chinoy's
Star Wars
film was still in active development,
[
61
]
but there was otherwise little news shared about the movie.
[
62
]
At a question and answer panel in Feburary, Ridley had stated she wanted to go to Celebration Japan but teased she "might be doing something then production-wise" instead, a comment that
Collider
reported on as "ominous."
[
63
]
In a May interview with
Happy Sad Confused
, Finn actor John Boyega shared that he was excited for the film and believed it made sense to expand the franchise with a Ridley-led movie, with Boyega further expressing hope that she would have a chance to shine as a Jedi and as the star of
Star Wars
. However, he also expressed worry that Ridley's film would not be finished, citing recent, canceled
Star Wars
projects.
[
60
]
Boyega's comments appeared to confirm he would not be returning in the film.
[
62
]
Release and reception
[
]
On April 20, 2023, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy announced that her project would be "the next
Star Wars
film" to release,
[
34
]
meaning the film would inhabit the soonest reserved
Star Wars
release date slot on Disney's release schedule, which, at the time, was
December 19
, 2025.
[
64
]
After the start of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, Disney shifted their theatrical film release slate in June, with the release date slot being pushed to
May 22
,
2026
.
[
65
]
On
January 9
, 2024, however, it was announced that
The Mandalorian and Grogu
would in fact be the next film to be released,
[
66
]
and was later confirmed to inhabit the May 2026 slot.
