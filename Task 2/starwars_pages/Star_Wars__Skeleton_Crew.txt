Star Wars: Timelines
dates the events of "
Chapter 1: The Mandalorian
" of
The Mandalorian
Season One
to
9 ABY
. In addition,
"
A Certain Point of View
" —
Star Wars Insider
228
also dates "
Part Seven: Dreams and Madness
" to nine
years
after the events of
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, which corresponds to 9
ABY
per
Timelines
. "Part Seven: Dreams and Madness" takes place after the
conflict on Mandalore
, which is the main event depicted in "
Chapter 23: The Spies
" and "
Chapter 24: The Return
," the final two episodes of
The Mandalorian
Season Three
. Therefore, Seasons One through Three of
Star Wars: The Mandalorian
must all be set in 9 ABY as well.
