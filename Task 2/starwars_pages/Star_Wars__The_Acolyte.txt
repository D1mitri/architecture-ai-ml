"
I think you see more morally ambiguous characters than you've seen in other Star Wars content. And I think I can say this pretty confidently: I don't think you're going to see action in other shows the way that you see it used and utilized in our show. I just thought it was very interesting to do a show about the bad guys and to set that during that period made the most sense, so I think that's what sets it apart. It's kind of almost flipped. We have more Jedi than you've seen in any other of the Star Wars content. I can say this pretty confidently, I don't think you're going to see action in other shows the way that you see it utilized in our show.

The cover to the original pitch deck Leslye Headland used when pitching the series to Lucasfilm in 2019, with imagery created by artist Inga Headland
Leslye Headland
, having served as co-creator for the
2019
Russian Doll
television series, in her words "essentially cold-called
Lucasfilm
"
[

in 2019
[

and pitched what would become
The Acolyte
as a cross between
Disney's
2013
film
Frozen
and
Quentin Tarantino's
2003
film
Kill Bill
.
[
13
]
For the initial pitch to Lucasfilm, Headland worked with her sister
Inga Headland
to design a
pitch deck
of imagery paired with story details for the presentation, the cover of which featured a woman in dark clothing cloaked in fog, with the title "Acolyte" displayed above.
[

]
The series' main characters of
Verosha "Osha" Aniseya
and
Mae-ho "Mae" Aniseya
were inspired by Headland's relationship with her youngest sister, and Lucasfilm's President
Kathleen Kennedy
told Headland to fashion her
Star Wars
story akin to her "incredibly emotional" play
Cult of Love
about siblinghood. Kennedy responded to Headland's early scripts in 2019: "You've written a great
Star Wars
show. Now go write a Leslye Headland show.

According to a

[

Inspiration and filming
[
]
"
She's like an orchestra director. She has an eye on everything very calmly from above, navigating with such kindness and grace. And because she's such a passionate, creative person, she has such love for every single craft on set. She was always so excited and she had so much respect for everyone. And that's really rare.
"
"
I love somebody who's unafraid to live in who they are and their energy unapologetically. Most people in the world are attracted to that kind of freedom.
"
―Dafne Keen and Charlie Barnett, on Leslye Headland's direction

Literary and
Star Wars
influences
[
]
Leslye Headland drew from storytelling in both the
Star Wars
Legends
continuity, such as its 1990s roleplaying games as part of what was then known as the "Expanded Universe" beyond the stories of
Star Wars
creator
George Lucas
, and the ongoing
Star Wars: The High Republic
multimedia project that was launched by Lucasfilm Publishing in 2021. The concept of an acolyte, after which the series is titled, was taken from the Legends continuity; a
Sith Acolyte
refers to an individual being trained for the position of a
Sith
's formal
apprentice
. Headland included
Vernestra Rwoh
, who was introduced as a
Jedi
Padawan
learner in
Justina Ireland
's 2021 novel
A Test of Courage
, set during the golden age of the
Galactic Republic
's
democracy
and the
Jedi Order
in the
High Republic Era
in
232 BBY
.
The Acolyte
is set a hundred years afterward and stars Rwoh as a
Jedi Master
. The series is also set a hundred years before
George Lucas
'
prequel trilogy
.
[
22
]
Headland thought about
Jedi Masters
Mace Windu
and
Yoda
's remarks about the relative dormancy of the
dark side of the Force
in the
1999
prequel film,
Star Wars
: Episode I
The Phantom Menace
, asking who would have been practicing the dark side in the century leading up to the
Sith
's return and the rise of the
Galactic Empire
, as shown in
2002
's
Star Wars
: Episode II
Attack of the Clones
and
2005
's
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Sith
. Headland also compares the time of the High Republic in which
The Acolyte
is set to the isolationist tendencies of the
United States
post-
World War I
, particularly in terms of the decay of the High Republic to the time of the
prequel trilogy
, when
Darth Sidious
infiltrated the
Galactic Senate
.
[
22
]
In terms of spirituality in
Star Wars
, Headland felt that the concept of the Force as explained by Yoda in
The Empire Strikes Back
strongly resonated with her, as compared to "even" the
English
author
J.R.R. Tolkien
, whose
The Lord of the Rings
fantasy was published in the
1950s
, or her own
Catholic
upbringing.
[
22
]
The fantasy aspect of
the galaxy
far, far away also prompted her to compare it to the realm of
Narnia
created by
C. S. Lewis
, a contemporary of Tolkien's. Headland had a tattoo printed on her right hand after Lucasfilm hired her for
The Acolyte
, serving as a reminder of
Star Wars
to herself while making the series—the tattoo shows
Ralph McQuarrie
's concept illustration of
Princess
Leia Organa
for Lucas'
original trilogy
, released between
1977
and
1983
.
[
23
]
Cinematic influences
[
]
Hong Kong Chinese martial arts and Japanese samurai cinema
[
]
Headland also drew inspiration from her favorite martial arts films. The
Hong Kong
Shaw Brothers Studio
film
Come Drink with Me
—directed by
King Hu
, set in the
Ming era
(1368—1644), and released in
1966
under the
Chinese
title 大醉俠—features a sequence at an inn that forms the basis of the
Lomi Usqi Noodle Shop
at the opening of
The Acolyte
'
s first episode, "
Lost / Found
."
[
24
]
The fight sequence there between Jedi Master
Indara
and the assassin
Mae
also pays homage to the martial arts choreography of
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
, a
2000
Ang Lee
film titled in Chinese as 臥虎藏龍.
[
25
]
Aside from
Chinese martial arts films
, known as "mouhap" in
Cantonese
and "wuxia" in
Mandarin
, Headland was also inspired by the
Japanese samurai
film
Yojimbo
, directed by
Akira Kurosawa
and released under the
Japanese
title 用心棒 in 1961.
[
23
]
She explained that
Star Wars: The Mandalorian
producer
Jon Favreau
had mentioned that George Lucas had been influenced by Kurosawa's filmmaking and
Western films
, and Headland herself based her cinematic influences more strongly on martial arts films such as Shaw Brothers and King Hu productions—naming
Come Drink with Me
alongside King Hu's 1971 film
A Touch of Zen
, in Chinese titled 俠女—that are "less global and galactic," with deeply personal missions in which the warriors felt "wronged" and had to "make it right."
[
22
]
As a mystery thriller,
The Acolyte
was influenced by Kurosawa's film
Rashomon
, released in
1950
under the Japanese title 羅生門, for its use of differing interpretations of the same events.
[
23
]
Cinematographer
Chris Teague
additionally cited the 1973
Toshiya Fujita
film
Lady Snowblood
, a period drama titled 修羅雪姫 in Japanese, as an inspiration for
The Acolyte
'
s camerawork.
[
26
]
Character inspirations
[
]
Headland compared the story of Mae to
Frozen
and
Kill Bill
, and the character was also inspired by the story of
Ahsoka Tano
in the
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
television series' 2013 episode "
The Wrong Jedi
" and the dynamic between
Qi'ra
and
Maul
at the end of the 2016 film
Solo: A Star Wars Story
.
[
27
]
Amandla Stenberg wrote about the motivations and inner lives of Osha and Mae,
[
18
]
with separate binders for each twin to inform her approach as a performer and differentiating the characters.
[
28
]
Indara was inspired by the character
Trinity
from
the Wachowskis'
The Matrix
film franchise (1999—2021), played by
Carrie-Anne Moss
, who Headland also cast as Master Indara.
[
29
]
For the first episode, "Lost / Found," Headland described the character's demeanor as both relaxed and controlled; a mix of Lucas' Skywalker saga Jedi character
Obi-Wan Kenobi
and the character O-Ren Ishii from
Kill Bill
.
[
30
]
Mae's accomplice,
Qimir
, is played by
Manny Jacinto
as a scoundrel archetype based on
Johnny Depp
's performance of
Jack Sparrow
in the
Pirates of the Caribbean
film series (2003–2017). Jacinto also compared Qimir's movements to the
silent film
works by
Buster Keaton
and
Charlie Chaplin
in the early 20th century.
[
31
]
Jacinto appreciated the duality of his character as a dream role for an actor, being able to emphasize the comic qualities of Qimir and then the stillness of the Stranger.
[
32
]
The fourth and fifth episodes, respectively titled "
Day
" and "
Night
," were partly inspired by two
Hollywood
science fiction films:
Ridley Scott's
1979
Alien
and
John McTiernan's
1987
Predator
.
[
33
]
Given his dual role as the Stranger, Jacinto was additionally inspired by
Toshiro Mifune's
performance as the warrior Kikushiyo in 1954's
Seven Samurai
, a Kurosawa film named 七人の侍 in Japanese, and
Jackie Chan's
performance as the martial artist
Wong Fei-hung
in the
Hong Kong
film
Drunken Master
, released as 醉拳 in
1978
.
[

Production design
[
]
"
If you look at periods of extended peace in history, you have things like the Renaissance, where art, design, architecture, and clothing are allowed to flourish because the money, resources, and creativity are available to make beautiful things. So, that was part of the design ethos that Kevin took onboard, as well as the costume design. The costumes, the lightsabers, even to some extent the ships, feel less brutal and more designed and finessed. The Jedi's robes have more gold and are more regal. There are more curves and flowing lines in the ships.
"
―Visual effects supervisor Julian Foddy
[
35
]
Brendok's mountain retreat was inspired by the 1947 British film
Black Narcissus
by
Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger
—set at a nuns' mountain retreat in the
Indian
Himalayas
—coupled with the
Hoover Dam
in the United States.
[
26
]
For Coruscant and its Jedi Temple, production designer
Kevin Jenkins
and visual effects supervisor
Julian Foddy
decided aligning moreso with the prequel trilogy's establishing shots than the ground-level perspective shown in the 2022 television series
Star Wars: Andor
, but with distinctive aesthetics echoing the 1971
William Friedkin
film
The French Connection
and 1970s
New York City
: in particular, a desaturated and photorealistic "retro" atmosphere of haziness.
[
36
]
Jenkins heeded George Lucas' 1977 film
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
'
s
lived-in aesthetic, stating that the core of
Star Wars
is
Stanley Kubrick's
1968 film
2001: A Space Odyssey
"with dirt"—he learned from the designs of
A New Hope
production crew
John Barry
,
Norman Reynolds
, and Ralph McQuarrie while cinematographer Chris Teague used anamorphic lenses for
The Acolyte
, with film grain being added to the footage. Jenkins also likened Headland's episodic structure to the cliffhanger-based approach of the
Flash Gordon
serials, and further compared the High Republic Era to the height of the
Roman Empire
, incorporating vivid colors in
The Acolyte
'
s production design while maintaining a uniformity of Jedi designs previously shown in
The High Republic
publishing initiative.
[
26
]
Jenkins said Olega's city was "essentially
Casablanca
in space" with its blue and red color palette,
[
37
]
while StarWars.com stated it was inspired by
Marrakesh
, another city in
Morocco
.
[
38
]
Costume designer
Jennifer Bryan
researched
Trisha Biggar
's prequel trilogy costumes at the
Lucasfilm Archives
at
Skywalker Ranch
, which particularly informed the clothing of the High Republic Era Jedi along with existing designs, such as High Republic Jedi symbols, from the multimedia project. The color palette of Osha's civilian clothing was informed by the era of the
Vietnam War
that preceded George Lucas' original trilogy and the
Star Wars
design principle of greeblies and badges. Another distinctive
Star Wars
fashion staple, the poncho, was also incorporated in civilian clothing featured in later episodes. Bryan further took inspiration from warrior cultures from
Asia Minor
,
East Africa
,
North Africa
, and the Roman and
Byzantine Empires
: "It needs to look like it's put together from these different historical eras of warriors, but not specific to any one culture." Mae's assassin attire in particular was informed by samurai elements. Bryan also thought that Jodie Turner-Smith's elegance complemented the design made for Mother Aniseya, while
Yord Fandar
's fastidiousness and "lustrous drape" called for fabrics slightly different from those used on other Jedi costumes, with his more appearance-conscious attitude reflected in a cloak informed by Roman senators'
togas
.
[
39
]
The production gave special thanks to the historic Lucasfilm Archives at Skywalker Ranch and George Lucas' new
Lucas Museum of Narrative Art
.
[
9
]
Leslye Headland emphasized using practical techniques in her direction of the production design, cinematography, and visual effects.
[

Filming in Madeira, Wales, and England
[
]
"
What was really interesting about Wales, especially Southern Wales, is that it had a very raw sort of feeling to it. What also gravitated us to the area was the location of the landing of the [Jedi starship]
Polan
, which became our anchor base. Just behind us in that same valley was this old 18th century dam, this massive black stone brick wall. And nearby was this wonderful forest where the whole floor was a bed of moss growing up the trees that I thought could be where the girls are first introduced. So with the moss forest, the valley vistas and this dam that's singing out to be used, Wales just seemed to tick all the boxes.
"
―Kevin Jenkins
[
37
]
Filming began in Europe's autumn in 2022 and lasted until May of 2023.
[
36
]
Filming was largely done on location on
Portugal's
Madeira
archipelago off the coast of
Africa
and in and around the mountainous forest of the
Bannau Brycheiniog National Park
(Brecon Beacons) in
Wales
. Interior scenes were shot at
Shinfield Studios
in
Berkshire
,
England
.
[
37
]
Shooting also took place at the woods of Berkshire's
Englefield Estate
.
[
40
]
Manny Jacinto prepared for his role as Qimir in the relative seclusion of the nearby town of
Windsor
.
[
34
]
Sur Film
provided production services in Portugal.
[
9
]
The crew initially used Madeira for the planet
Khofar
's jungles, but they made use of other parts of the archipelago for scenes set on
Olega
,
Ueda
, and the
Unknown Planet
as well.
[
26
]
Khofar's forest perimeter was shot at Pico do Arieiro and digitally inserted to shots of the Fanal Forest and Poço das Casas. The interior of the jungles was filmed at Shinfield Studios, with practical "mega trees" occupying the soundstage and even some of its stage doors. A short scene of Ueda was shot at Ponta de São Lourenço for its "brown, dusty Western" aesthetic, and the establishing shot of Olega was shot at Pedra D'Eira. Olega's city scenes were shot in Shinfield Studios. The exterior island shots of the "unknown planet" were captured along the northern coastline of western Madeira, and the mouth of Stranger's cave is located at Ribeira de Janela. "Fifteen minutes down the road," the crew found the Porto Moniz Rockpools and shot the Stranger's bathing scene there.

A dead oak tree in southern Wales is dressed in yellow willow-like branches.
An empty lot and several fields near the
Trago Mills
department store in
Merthyr Tydfil
were used for
The Acolyte
'
s production in Wales.
[
41
]
The series introduces the planet Brendok, with all of its exterior scenes being shot in Southern Wales—aside from the campfire scene, shot at England's
Pinewood Studios
in
Iver Heath
,
Buckinghamshire
. The crew filmed in the mossy Taf Fechan forest, a dead oak tree in the Cadlan Woods that was decorated for the yellow willow-like
bunta tree
, and the drained Upper Neuadd Reservoir of Bannau Brycheiniog. The Upper Neuadd Dam served as the exterior of the Brendok
witch coven
's
mountain retreat
. The dam informed the design of the retreat, and its interior scenes were shot at Shinfield Studios.
[
37
]
The series was shot with cameras and
ARRI
ALFA lenses supplied by ARRI Rental.
[

Post-production in London, Canada, India, Austria, Australia, and California
[
]
"
The musical themes in
The Acolyte
are tied more to an emotion or a point of view or a literary theme than they are to a particular character.
"
―Composer
Michael Abels
[
42
]
The series was edited by
Miikka Leskinen
and
Cheryl Potter
with
Avid
editing equipment supplied by HireWorks. Sound services were provided by
Skywalker Sound
in
Marin County, California
, with
Brian Chumney
as the supervising sound editor.
[
9
]
Visual effects post-production was led by
Industrial Light & Magic
(ILM), a Lucasfilm subsidiary, with its studios in
London
, England, and
Vancouver
,
Canada
, extending through to the late end of winter in 2024. ILM's new office in
Mumbai
,
India
, also contributed to the nearly 3000 shots made for
The Acolyte
, marking one of its first completed works.
[
36
]
Additional visual effects were made by
Yannix
and
SDFX Studios
,
[
9
]
as well as the London-based
Outpost Visual Effects
and the Vancouver-based
beloFX
.
[
36
]
Visual effects were also partly produced in
Melbourne
,
Australia
,
[
9
]
with
Rising Sun Pictures
of nearby
Adelaide
and the
Los Angeles
–based
Luma Pictures
having contributed too,
[
36
]
as did
Hybride
of
Ubisoft
[
9
]
in
Montreal
, Canada.
[
36
]
Proof Inc.
additionally provided visualization services.
[
9
]
Unlike previous productions centered at ILM's headquarters in
San Francisco
, California, ILM London served as the visual effects post-production hub for
The Acolyte
, led by production supervisor Julian Foddy. The visual effects crew worked closely with the creatures' department led by
Neal Scanlan
and editors Leskinen and Potter for the hybrid practical effects and computer graphics shots of the
umbramoths
.
[
35
]
The score of
The Acolyte
was composed by Michael Abels with additional music by
Miguel Bezanilla
,
Cameron Moody
, and
Robert Wallace
. The score was recorded at
Synchron Stage Vienna
in
Austria
under the conductor
Gottfried Rabl
.
[
9
]
Abels pointed out that the musical themes were emotion-based rather than character-based, taking the example of the "duality of the characters" Mae and Osha when they are vengeful or hopeful, with the same musical motifs occurring with different characters. Abels added that "You can tell I've had a lot of fun playing with how the Force is used and who uses it and what we think about whether that use of the Force is good or bad." While the score does not foreshadow or connect the music associated with Qimir with the Stranger, when the Stranger is revealed at the end of "Day," the music includes a nod to
Kylo Ren's theme
. In keeping with the cinematic echo with
Rashomon
, the two flashback episodes include scenes in which the visuals are the same yet the music is different to accentuate different emotional perspectives.
[

Production finance
[
]
"
The Acolyte
had many strong reviews and did well in the ratings its first week out, but you ultimately opted against a second season. Why didn't you move forward? And can you offer any hint as to how
Skeleton Crew
is doing, or its future?
"
"
So as it relates to
Acolyte
, we were happy with our performance, but it wasn't where we needed it to be given the cost structure of that title, quite frankly, to go and make a season two. So that's the reason why we didn't do that.
Skeleton Crew
is in process now, so we'll see. We've seen some growth on that. We’ll see how that goes. As you said, the reviews have been excellent on
Skeleton Crew
, so we'll have to see how that all plays out as it moves forward.

Province of British Columbia
Production Service Tax Credit,
Québec's
Production Services Tax Credit, Portugal's Tourism and Cinema Fund, and the Australian Government's PDV Offset tax rebate. Visual effects production in Australia was also supported by

While media outlets reported that the series' production cost was around $180 million in
US dollars
,
[
13

Lucasfilm had registered a subsidiary high-end television program production company in
England and Wales
named Blue Stockings (UK). The company's publicly filed audit covering
March 24
, 2021 to
September 24
2023, reports that "the cost was forecasted to be over the production budget" but are approved and fully funded by Lucasfilm as of September 24, 2024, with the production having been certified by the
British Film Institute
in the interim as "British,"
[
44

which would qualify the production for
HM Revenue and Customs

Based on the UK tax relief scheme, the same filing claims a total of £34,839,012 pounds of expenditure credits for the relevant periods—which would bring Blue Stockings' production cost down to £137,481,852 pounds, equivalent to just under $184 million US dollars.

Release and harassment

"
She put so much care and thought and love into that, and it's disappointing to feel like your studio is not having your back in a very public-facing way. They've got to stop doing this thing where they don't say anything when people are getting fucking dog-piled on the internet with racism and bullshit. It's just not fair to not say anything. It's really unfair. It would just be nice if the people that have all the money were showing their support and putting their feet down, say this is unacceptable: 'You're not a fan if you do this.' Make a really big statement and just see if any money leaves. I bet you it won't, because people of colour, and especially Black people, make up a very large percentage of buying power. They might find that it's actually more lucrative for them, but everyone's using 'woke' like it's a dirty word. Opinions change. What's in vogue changes. We're gonna get there at some point, to that place where people stop having a stick up their arse about people of colour being a part of IPs that were created by white people. You know why? Because we're never going to fucking stop participating.

―Jodie Turner-Smith, criticizing Disney and Lucasfilm's passivity to targeted harassment of Amandla Stenberg

Amandla Stenberg
In 2024, Lucasfilm released the series' teaser trailer online on
March 18

prior to releasing the final trailer on May 4 online
[

Later on the

Star Wars
violin arrangement of "
The Force Theme
" that composer
John Williams
had written specifically for her,

On
June 19
, the date of "
Juneteenth
" commemorations of the
end of slavery
in the United States, Amandla Stenberg posted a music video on
Instagram
addressing the tired bigotry of discourse around
The Acolyte
. She criticized the transformation of the term "
woke
" for
culture war
and
clickbait
purposes, including journalists who sacrifice "truth" for selective "metrics and data" that fuel division. Co-stars
Charlie Barnett
, Manny Jacinto, and
Dafne Keen
commented in support of Stenberg.

Deadline
first reported that the show had been "canceled" and would not have a second season,
[

and
Gizmodo
published an updated report that Lucasfilm confirmed to the media outlet that there would not be a second season of
The Acolyte

[

Twitter
owner
Elon Musk
later reacted to the news on the social media platform to suggest that the series is "woke."
[
48

The Acolyte
writer
Jen Richards
criticized the Hollywood industry on Twitter on
August 20
for its aversion to "risk" and studio monopolies that only care about immediate financial profits for shareholders rather than art and culture.
John Boyega
, who had played
Finn
in the
sequel trilogy
and faced racist abuse for his role, acknowledged Amandla Stenberg on an old Instagram post of hers on
August 21
amidst a flurry of hateful comments.
[
53

In an article titled "Can the Best of Star Wars Survive the Worst of Its Fans?" on
August 23
, the
Rolling Stone
reported that neither Lucasfilm nor Disney representatives have responded to their requests for comment on the series' discontinuation.
[

On the same day,
Entertainment Weekly
reported that Lee Jung-jae was "surprised" by the news and hoped that Disney would invite showrunner Leslye Headland to make a second season of
The Acolyte
,
[

and via Instagram's story feature, Rebecca Henderson reposted both the aforementioned
Rolling Stone

Cancellation aftermath
[
]
"
I'm going to be transparent and say it’s not a huge shock for me. There has been a rampage of vitriol that we have faced since the show was even announced, when it was still just a concept and no one had even seen it. That's when we started experiencing a rampage of, I would say, hyper-conservative bigotry and vitriol, prejudice, hatred and hateful language towards us.
"
―Amandla Stenberg, on the cancellation of
The Acolyte
[
56
]
On
August 28
, Stenberg spoke about
The Acolyte
'
s cancelation via Instagram stories. The artist said it was "not a huge shock" for them given the "hyper-conservative bigotry and vitriol, prejudice, hatred, and hateful language" with which "the alt-right" targeted the series' creators such as herself—starting when the series was just announced in 2020 through the announcement of Stenberg's casting in 2022 to the series' release in 2024—though she also thanked "everybody who watched it" and appreciated the fans' support, artwork, and theories. They also spoke about how part of processing the vitriol meant being personally vocal in line with her own values despite working under Disney, and called her role in
Star Wars
"an incredible honor and dream" and gave high praise to Lucasfilm, the "vision" of producer Rayne Roberts, and showrunner Leslye Headland: "I will love this experience with her forever." As for the fans, Stenberg wanted to say that they are "deeply loved and appreciated, and it made this job all the worthwhile." Stenberg lastly expressed that "
we all exist in the context in all which we live
," calling on people to vote in the
2024 United States elections
and also referring to the "hyper divisiveness" of internet discourse around
Star Wars
that they found has been "driven by echo chambers of thought and algorithms that reinforce our biases," and she wanted to "challenge us all and challenge myself to continue questioning what it is that I digest and think critically about what shapes it."

cover for

On

Ahmed Best
, who had faced vicious abuse for his role as
Jar Jar Binks
in the
prequel trilogy
, posted in solidarity with Amandla Stenberg on Instagram.
[
57

On
October 2
, in an interview with
Glamour
magazine for its Women of the Year Awards, Jodie Turner-Smith praised Amandla Stenberg's dedication to her role and criticized the movie studios for being unsupportive of the actor even while racist abuse runs rampant online. Turner-Smith believed that making a statement against racist abuse would not incur damage to corporate revenue given that people of color, particularly Black people, "make up a very large percentage of buying power." She added that opinions and trends attacking people of color for taking part in intellectual properties started by white people, such as
Star Wars
, would eventually pass even though people such as herself "don't get to fail upwards like a lot of white men."
[
18
]
In an interview with
Vanity Fair
later in November, Lee Jung-jae said that he felt "hurt" and was especially sorry for Leslye Headland by the racist reactions to
The Acolyte
, though he added that he has faith for racism to eventually end. Lee also expressed gratitude for the support of fans and had "strong hopes" for audiences to better appreciate the series as time goes by.
[
58
]
On
December 19
, 2024, in an interview with Josef Adalian for the
Vulture
news website, Alan Bergman, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, acknowledged in reply to a question about both
The Acolyte
and the
Star Wars: Skeleton Crew
television series that premiered earlier that month that
The Acolyte
was not renewed for a second season. Despite both series receiving good reviews, Bergman blamed "the cost structure" of
The Acolyte
even though "we were happy with our performance."
[

Possibility of a return?
[
]
Manny Jacinto (pictured in character as "the Stranger") has expressed a great interest in seeing
The Acolyte
return.
In January 2025, Luminate's end-of-year analysis for 2024 found that
The Acolyte
was viewed for 2.7 billion minutes on Disney+, ranking second only to the 3 billion of the television series
Percy Jackson and the Olympians
on the streaming platform.
[
59

Jecki Lon actress
Dafne Keen
admitted to
Screen Rant
that the cancellation had been, at least as she saw things, an "overwhelming" matter for all involved. However, Keen also stated she was proud of her work on the series and proud of how Stenberg had handled the cancellation.
[

Senator
Worus Rayencourt
actor
David Harewood
expressed a desire to return to the series in
July
2025
via his Bluesky account and asked fans to continue pushing for the show's return if they wanted another season.
[
61
]
The Stranger actor Manny Jacinto has also been vocal about his hope to return to
The Acolyte
. In a late 2024 panel, upon being asked what one of his life goals was, Jacinto stated that he wanted there to be a second season of
The Acolyte
and hoped to appear within it.
[
62
]
In
August
2025, Jacinto stated that he would love to return to the character of the Stranger, remarking that, "if the fans want it, I'm down and ready to go" while also praising the team behind
The Acolyte
and the greater
Star Wars
franchise.
