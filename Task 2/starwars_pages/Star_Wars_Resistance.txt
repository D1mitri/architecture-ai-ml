"
We wanted to have a series where the lead doesn't have the Force, and he's just trying to make his way through the galaxy and trying to become this hero without any Force-wielders.

Plot summary
[
]
"
We wanted to give a slice of life in a part of the galaxy that wasn't about the Jedi. How do people who are maybe not as connected with the Force, or at least they don't think they are, how did they respond to these threats? What do we do in the meantime when there isn't really a war going on?
"
―Justin Ridge
[
14
]
The series is set between the events of
Star Wars
: Episode VI
Return of the Jedi
and
Star Wars
: Episode VII
The Force Awakens
, in a time when the
Resistance
is still learning about the
growing threat
of the
First Order
. It centers on the character of
Kazuda Xiono
, a young
pilot
in
General
Leia Organa's
Resistance
who is tasked with spying on the growing threat of the First Order.
[

]
Slashfilm
reported November 12, 2018 that a more specific timeline was revealed in episode 1.6 of
Resistance Rewind
. In that episode, executive producer Justin Ridge let slip that
Star Wars Resistance
takes place six months before the events of
The Force Awakens
, revealing: "Because this series takes place six months before The Force Awakens we have a lot of connective tissue to what we see in the movie. So eventually our events in the show will parallel what happens in the movie."

"
So right now, Resistance is a bit different, in that I'm not on that day-to-day. I created and set it in motion, but I've given that to other people to raise up, people that I've worked with a long time, who I think deserve the opportunity to tell stories and I think it's exciting, and I give them my thoughts and notes – I was just doing that this morning, like George would give me. So that's fun.
"
―Dave Filoni on his involvement with the series
[
16
]
A promotional banner released with the announcement of
Star Wars Resistance
on StarWars.com
Star Wars Resistance
was created by
Dave Filoni
, head of
Lucasfilm Animation
who led the creative team on
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
and
Star Wars Rebels
. The inspiration for the series was Filoni's interest in
World War II
aircraft and fighter pilots, with his grandfather's time as a pilot during the war being a particular influence on him. In the announcement of the series, Filoni noted that the series would capture the sense of excitement around high-speed racing, which
Star Wars
had depicted in many stories over the years.
[
1
]
Executive producer
Justin Ridge
elaborated: "It was a concept Dave came up with: he wanted to have a show that went more into 'How is the First Order gathering materials? What is the First Order doing before
The Force Awakens
?' It grew from that initial seed."
[
17
]
For the show's setting, Filoni was also inspired by the sitcom
Cheers
; executive producer
Athena Yvette Portillo
explained this to
StarWars.com
: "He said, 'I want a show that takes place in one set that you go to constantly. You get to know the patrons, you get to know the people, and you introduce new characters…and it's all about their way of life.
'
"
[
13
]
Resistance
begins six months before the
Battle of Starkiller Base
, and eventually crosses over with the events of
Star Wars
: Episode VII
The Force Awakens
.
[
18
]
When the series began development, the creative team was unsure of the details of
Star Wars
: Episode VIII
The Last Jedi
and
Star Wars
: Episode IX
The Rise of Skywalker
, so they had to be careful to avoid any possible continuity conflicts with those films.
[
19
]
The show was planned to last only two seasons, so as to bridge the gap between the two films.
[

In
September
2016
,
Disney Television
president
Ben Sherwood
revealed that he had been working with Lucasfilm on a new animated series.
[
22
]
When the
third season
of
Star Wars Rebels
debuted, it was announced that Filoni had stepped down as Supervising Director, in lieu of helping to develop "future animation development."
[
23
]
Pablo Hidalgo
revealed that Filoni and crew were working on the new series as of
September
2017

[

In
February
2018
, it was reported that
Lucasfilm
filed a trademark for the name
Star Wars Resistance
[
25

(rumors of such a series had stretched back to
2014
).
[
27
]
The series was officially announced on
April 26
, 2018 for a debut in the fall of that year.
[
1
]
Despite creating the show, Filoni confirmed in an
August 12
interview that he would not be working as directly in a day-to-day capacity on
Resistance
as he had on previous projects, given his work on the
revival
of
The Clone Wars
, but he would still provide notes and direction to the story team, a role Filoni compared to
George Lucas
' input on
The Clone Wars
.
[
16
]
The show's animations were produced by
Polygon Pictures
.
[
28
]
They are rendered in
CG
and based on the
anime
animation style,
[
29
]
[
1
]
with major inspirations being
Robotech
,
Lupin the Third
and the films of
Hayao Miyazaki
.
[
30
]
Many of the show's designs are based on unused
original trilogy
concept sketches from artists such as
Joe Johnston
,
Ralph McQuarrie
, and
Nilo Rodis-Jamero
.
[
31
]
During production, the animated series was called "Zero."
