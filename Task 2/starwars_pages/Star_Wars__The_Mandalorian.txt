the television series

Din Djarin

The Mandalorian
"

"
I'm trying to evoke the aesthetics of not just the original trilogy but the first film. Not just the first film but the first act of the first film. What was it like on Tatooine? What was going on in that cantina? That has fascinated me since I was a child, and I love the idea of the darker, freakier side of Star Wars, the Mad Max aspect of Star Wars.

"
It's like after the Roman Empire falls, or when you don't have a centralized shogun in Japan—and, of course, the Old West, when there wasn't any government in the areas that had not yet been settled.
"
―Jon Favreau
[
18
]
After the stories of Jango and Boba Fett, another warrior emerges in the
Star Wars
universe.
The Mandalorian
is set after the fall of the Empire and before the emergence of the First Order. We follow the travels of a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy far from the authority of the New Republic....
[

Development
[
]
"
I had a pitch for a concept of following the archetypes that influenced George Lucas whether it was the Western, the samurai film, the World War II film, earlier space operas, cliffhangers, Flash Gordon—looking at the films and the archetypes that influenced George was a way for us to make a smaller story that would work for the scale of the small screen and get back to the basics.
"
―Jon Favreau
[

In
2005
,
[
21
]
George Lucas
began developing a
live-action TV series
that would explore the criminal underworld of
Star Wars
.
[
22
]
Producer
Rick McCallum
compared it to
Deadwood
and
The Godfather
,
[
23
]
[
24
]
and hinted that it would involve bounty hunters.
[
25
]
At the
2007
Toy Fair
, a poster teased upcoming
Star Wars
projects, with the TV series represented by a picture of Boba Fett.
[
26
]
After 50 scripts were completed, Lucas and McCallum felt that the show would be too expensive to produce with the current technology, and thus decided to put the project on hold.
[
27
]
[
24
]
In
2012
, Lucas sold
Lucasfilm
to
The Walt Disney Company
.
[
28
]
Under Disney, a
film centered on Boba Fett
was reportedly planned to be produced as part of its
Anthology Series
.
[
29
]
In
September
2017
, Lucasfilm head
Kathleen Kennedy
reached out to
Jon Favreau
for possible ideas for
Disney+
, for which the company looked to create original content. He expressed interest in doing something with the
Mandalorians
, having reflected on some concepts he had developed when he first heard that Disney gained control of the franchise. In November, Favreau met with Kennedy and
Carrie Beck
to pitch his idea for the show. At the meeting, Kennedy told him that
Dave Filoni
was also interested in telling stories about Mandalorians. (Filoni had also talked with Kennedy about wanting to work in live-action; She then sent him visit the sets of some of the contemporary
Star Wars
films to study the productions.) Favreau was familiar with Filoni, having voiced the Mandalorian character
Pre Vizsla
on
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
. A few days later, the three of them met again, this time accompanied by Filoni and
Christopher Yost
.
[

]
A new TV series was announced by Disney CEO
Robert Iger
during a Disney quarterly earnings call on
November 9
, 2017.
[
1
]
On
May 10
,
2018
, in an interview with
Anthony Carboni
on the premier for
Solo: A Star Wars Story
, Favreau revealed that he was halfway done with writing a season of the upcoming live-action
Star Wars
series.
[
31
]
As producer Kennedy recalled: "I'd been talking to him, off and on, for a few years. He had this story, and suddenly the two of us realized, not only could this be told in the television space, but we could also push technology."
[
32
]
During an interview with Dan Casey of
Nerdist
at the premiere, Favreau confirmed the show would take place seven
years
after the
Battle of Yavin
and feature all-new characters. Favreau also revealed that even before he had the job, he had written four scripts to show Lucasfilm what the show would be
[
33
]
and to ensure that his vision made it to the screen.
[
17
]
As writing continued, he had many discussions with co-executive producer Filoni, who would give him feedback based on his experience working directly with George Lucas on
The Clone Wars
. Filoni would make sketches of Favreau's ideas, which would be given to the department.
[
20
]
Reflecting on the writing process, Favreau told
GQ Middle East
, "One thing [George Lucas] said to me was, 'remember, Jon, the real audience for all stories and all myths is the kids that are coming of age', because he's really a
Joseph Campbell
adherent."
[
34
]
He also made a conscious effort to appeal to all types of
Star Wars
fans, telling
Entertainment Weekly
: "Part of what's fun is to see if we could merge the worlds of the original trilogy, the prequels, the sequels,
The Clone Wars
, and what's been considered canon up to this point and what's been considered part of
Legends
."

character sketches by Dave Filoni
On
August 6
, 2018,
The New York Times
reported that Favreau's
Star Wars
series, which would be produced for Disney's new streaming service, was expected to cost around $100 million for 10 episodes. In an email to
The New York Times
, Favreau stated that the service would allow for the opportunity to tell stories that go for several chapters.
[
36
]
On
October 26
, 2018, it was reported that the rumored Boba Fett film had been scrapped, with Lucasfilm instead focusing on
The Mandalorian
.
[
37
]
On
November 13
, 2018,
Pedro Pascal
was reported to be in negotiations to play the lead role in the series.
[
38
]
The
next day
,
Gina Carano
was announced to have joined the cast according to
Variety
.
[
39
]
On
November 30
,
Variety
again reported that
Nick Nolte
had been added to the show's cast.
[
40

On
December 12
, Lucasfilm officially announced the cast, confirming the casting of Pascal, Carano, and Nolte, along with
Giancarlo Esposito
,

Production
[
]
The series is mostly filmed on soundstages in Los Angeles,
[
41
]
with occasional plate photography in various international locations.
[
42
]
At the suggestion of
Rob Bredow
,
[
43
]
it uses a new technology known as "Stagecraft,"
[
44
]
with special effects that utilize a
video game
engine developed by
Epic Games
.
[
45
]
[
46
]
ILM also opened a new London-based division,
ILM TV
, to work on
The Mandalorian
and other projects.
[
47
]
Favreau described his role as showrunner: "It's a lot like being a chef. You write the menu, you staff up with people who are great at what they do, you oversee and help guide the people who are actually cooking the food, working the line, and then at the end, you plate." He compared his work on the series to that of
Iron Man
(in that the release of the former would mark the launch of Disney+, whereas the latter marked the launch of the
Marvel Cinematic Universe
), noting that he didn't feel much pressure on either project.
[
17
]
Director Bryce Dallas Howard described the production process as highly collaborative, with all the directors sharing an office, and the producers always open to ideas from the directors.
[
48
]
During production, Favreau shared photos on his
Instagram
account.
[
49
]
George Lucas visited the set during production as part of a birthday surprise for Favreau.
[
50
]
While filming at a studio in
Manhattan Beach, California
, equipment was stolen from the set, prompting a police investigation.

[
54
]
Robert Iger viewed each Season One episode multiple times to give notes and track the show's progress.
[
55
]
Members of the Star Wars costuming fan organization the

[

[
57

would arrive on
Christmas

.
[

Music
[
]
On
December 19
, 2018,
Ludwig Göransson
was announced to be composing the music for the show.
[
15
]
Göransson had previously composed the music for director
Ryan Coogler's
2018 film
Black Panther
; Favreau met him through Coogler, and discussed the project a year before production began on
The Mandalorian
. As Favreau told the
Los Angeles Times
, he wanted the music to be "a little grittier, a little edgier and a little more tech-oriented, something that felt half-tech, half-classic." Göransson took his initial inspiration from a nature hike, going for an "organic" sound that made heavy use of woodwinds, combined with
electronic instruments
and orchestral music.
[
67
]
The first season's soundtrack was released in a limited 8-LP set, produced exclusively by mondoshop.com.
[
68
]
Göransson also wrote the music for the second season of the show
[
69
]
