R2-D2
destroys two
super battle droids
by setting them on fire.
It has been three
years
since the events of
Attack of the Clones
. The
Galactic Republic
is in the midst of the
epic war
with the
Confederacy of Independent Systems
under the leadership of
Count
Dooku
, who is also the
Sith Lord
,
Darth
Tyranus. The Confederacy's
cyborg
military leader,
General
Grievous
of the
Separatist Droid Army
, has brought the war to
Coruscant
and captured
Supreme Chancellor
Sheev Palpatine
, leader of the
Galactic Senate
, during a
massive space battle
.
As the
Separatist Droid Army
attempts to escape the Galactic capital, a massive space battle erupts, into which race
Jedi Master
Obi-Wan Kenobi
and his former
padawan
, now
Jedi Knight
Anakin Skywalker
, leading a mission to rescue the Chancellor. The
Jedi
fight through the Separatist armada. In the process, Obi-Wan's
interceptor
is damaged by
buzz droids
and his
astromech
,
R4-P17
, is destroyed. Anakin attempts to shoot the
droids
off, though succeeds only in blasting apart the wing of his former Master's vessel. Obi-Wan tells Anakin to hold his fire as he's not helping. Anakin agrees it was a bad idea. Obi-Wan tells Anakin to go on and rescue the Chancellor, but Anakin says he won't leave without Obi-Wan. Anakin uses one of his fighter wings to knock some of the buzz droids off Obi-Wan's fighter, but one manages to crawl onto Anakin's ship although it is quickly disabled by
R2-D2
. As they approach Grievous's flagship, the
Invisible Hand
,
Obi-Wan reminds Anakin their shields are still up, so Anakin breaks formation and attacks a shield generator, knocking out the shields on the docking bay of the ship. The destruction of it activates the ship' emergency breach door, which quickly begins closing. The two Jedi crash-land just before the door slams closed.
Anakin and Obi-Wan make their way through the flagship, using their
lightsabers
to fight through an army of droids. Meanwhile, R2-D2 aids them from the hangar bay while simultaneously incinerating a pair of
super battle droids
, using fuel and his thrusters.
Rescuing the chancellor
"
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate. You have anger. But you don't use them.
"
―Dooku to Anakin Skywalker
[

]
Count Dooku prepares to duel Anakin and Obi-Wan.
The Jedi reach the top, finding the captive Chancellor Palpatine. They are confronted by
Count
Dooku
himself, with Obi-Wan telling Anakin that they will fight Dooku together, and an intense
lightsaber duel
ensues. The Jedi throw the Count off guard, by converting from basic attacks to more skilled tactics. During the battle, Obi-Wan is rendered unconscious when Dooku uses
the Force
to hold him in mid-air by the throat before hurling him against a railing.
While Obi-Wan lays injured, Anakin continues the battle and is repeatedly taunted by Dooku. Using his anger, Anakin taps into the
dark side of the Force
and gets the better of the duel. He severs both of Dooku's hands, rendering him incapable of defending himself, and then holds him at blade point with both his own lightsaber and Dooku's weapon. Palpatine encourages Anakin to kill Dooku, much to the shock of the latter who looks at the Chancellor pleadingly, only to be met with a sinister smile from Palpatine. At first, Anakin hesitates but Palpatine firmly insists; completely unaware of Palpatine's true intentions, Anakin viciously decapitates the helpless Dooku. His body falls to the ground and his head falls fast to the ground and rolled like a bowling ball.
The
Invisible Hand
crosses paths with the
Venator
-class Star Destroyer
Guarlara
. A broadside attack begins with both ship firing their cannons, a shell from a Republic Venator destroy one of the
Invisible Hand
's cannons and ammo crates, causing the
Invisible Hand
to begin an uncontrolled descent into Coruscant. Despite Palpatine's persuasions that he should leave the unconscious Obi-Wan, Anakin carries him on his back, and maneuvers through the ship with the Chancellor. Obi-Wan later regains consciousness.
Confronting Grievous
"
That wasn't much of a rescue.
"
―General Grievous to Obi-Wan Kenobi

General
Grievous
aboard the bridge of his flagship,
Invisible Hand
After Grievous has the bridge crew regain control of his flagship by firing the emergency booster engines, he makes certain the two Jedi and their ward are captured. Having fallen foul of a
ray shield
trap, the three are brought to the bridge under custody, but R2 successfully creates a distraction, allowing the Jedi to retrieve their lightsabers and break free.
Grievous then sends a pair of his powerful
IG-100 MagnaGuard
droids after the Jedi. Obi-Wan quickly beheads the first MagnaGuard with his blade, but the droid continues the fight, forcing Obi-Wan to slice the droid warrior apart before it deactivates. Anakin finishes off the second MagnaGuard and destroys the
battle droids
attempting to drag Palpatine from the bridge. The Jedi close in on Grievous, though the wily General smashes a window with his fallen guard's
electrostaff
, and is swept outside. Using a tow cable, Grievous latches himself to the ship and heads for the
escape pods
. Launching all other escape capsules, Grievous speeds for the safety of a
Trade Federation
Lucrehulk
-class battleship
. Once again, the flagship begins to descend in free fall into Coruscant, though due to its extensive damage taken from its broadside cannon fight with the Guarlara and entering Coruscant's atmosphere, the ships hangar bay begins to weaken. After extending the ship's drag flaps, the hangar gives out and breaks off from the rest of the ship, sending them into a faster freefall. With the aid of a few
emergency firespeeders
they land, hitting a control tower along on one of Coruscant's industrial landing platforms.
Happy reunions

Another happy landing.

The
Jedi High Council
discusses the recent turn of events.
On Coruscant, Anakin is praised for his heroics. He meets secretly with
Padmé Amidala
, and they share a kiss in the shadows of the
Senate office building
, keeping their love secret. She reveals to him that she is pregnant with their child.
Elsewhere, Grievous, now both the political and military leader of the Separatists, arrives on
Utapau
, where
Trade Federation
Viceroy
Nute Gunray
,
Geonosian
Archduke
Poggle the Lesser
,
Techno Union
head of state and
Foreman
Wat Tambor
, and others on the
Separatist Council
remain in hiding. The General is contacted by Darth Sidious, who gives him instructions to move the Separatist leaders to a volcanic
planet
,
Mustafar
. He also explains that the war is almost over. Grievous is uncertain about this, given Count Dooku's death. Sidious assures him that Darth Tyranus's death and loss were necessary, for he would soon have a new
Sith apprentice
: one far younger and more powerful.
Later, on Coruscant, Anakin awakens in a panic, covered in sweat. He reveals to Padmé that he has been dreaming about her dying in childbirth, and believing that he can't live without her, vows not to let this dream come true.
Chancellor Palpatine requests Anakin's presence, and they meet in the
Chancellor's office
. The Senate has granted the Chancellor further emergency powers, giving him direct control of the
Jedi Council
. Palpatine confides in Anakin his fear, distrust, and contempt of the Masters. He appoints Anakin to be his personal representative on the Council.
The High Council begrudgingly accepts Anakin's appointment, but does not grant him the rank of Master. Anakin reacts angrily at this perceived slight, but is quickly shut down by
Mace Windu
. Ignoring his outburst, the Council goes on to discuss matters concerning the war. It is decided that Anakin will be assigned to protect the Chancellor, and
Yoda
will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the
Wookiees
on
Kashyyyk
. Anakin is angry and disappointed.
Obi-Wan later tells Anakin that the Council wants Anakin to report on all the Chancellor's dealings, essentially spying on him. Anakin is confused and upset, feeling torn between two friends and loyalties. Obi-Wan himself is unhappy with the situation.
The tragedy of Darth Plagueis

Is it possible to learn this power?

The
Supreme Chancellor
and Anakin Skywalker in Palpatine's private viewing box at the Galaxies Opera House
At the
Galaxies Opera House
in the
Uscru District
, Anakin joins Palpatine in watching the
Mon Calamari Aquatic Ballet
performing
Squid Lake
. Palpatine tells Anakin Clone Intelligence has located General Grievous hiding in the
Utapau
system. Anakin is delighted by this news, as Grievous's capture will accelerate the war's end. Palpatine remarks that he'd question the competence of the Jedi Council if Anakin was not sent on the mission. Inviting Anakin to join him, Palpatine dismisses his aides: once they are gone, Palpatine seduces Anakin to the dark side. He also tells Anakin that the Jedi Order wishes to overthrow the Republic and that if he has suspected it, Anakin must surely have sensed it. Anakin confirms that the Jedi don't trust him, a fact that Palpatine expands to include the Senate, the Republic, and democracy as a whole. Anakin tells Palpatine that his trust in the Jedi has been shaken and Palpatine deduces Anakin's distaste for the Council's mission to spy on the Chancellor. Palpatine takes Anakin back to some of the early political lessons Palpatine tried to teach him, about how all those who gain power are afraid to lose it and that includes the Jedi. Anakin tries to defend the Jedi by saying they use their powers for good, but Palpatine argues good is only a point of view, noting that in almost every conceivable manner, including a quest for greater power, the Sith and the Jedi are exactly alike. Anakin disagrees, remarking that the Sith depend on passion for strength, thinking only of themselves, whereas the Jedi are selfless, thinking only of others.
After a brief pause in their conversation, Palpatine makes a remark about the
tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise
. Palpatine describes
Darth Plagueis
as a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and wise that he could use the Force to influence the
midi-chlorians
to create life. Not only this, but having such power and knowledge of the dark side, Plagueis could use thistle ability to save people he cared about from death, a statement which gets Anakin's attention (which was Palpatine's desire) and Palpatine describes the dark side of the Force as a pathway to many abilities considered by some to be unnatural. When Anakin asks what happened to Darth Plagueis, Palpatine concludes that Plagueis became so powerful that all he feared was losing his power, which he eventually did. Unfortunately for Plagueis, he taught his apprentice, who happened to be Darth Sidious, all he knew: after he had, his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Palpatine notes the irony of how Plagueis could keep others from dying, but not himself. When Anakin asks if it is possible to learn the power to stop death, Palpatine simply replies, "Not from a Jedi," further alienating Anakin from the Jedi Order.
After Yoda arrives on Kashyyyk, Anakin relays the information about Grievous, explaining that a partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau. Yoda says they should act quickly and decisively on this information. When Anakin expresses his interest in going at Palpatine's request, Mace Windu harshly tells him that the Council will decide who goes and not the Chancellor. Yoda believes that a Master with more experience is needed to confront, and defeat, Grievous. Ki-Adi-Mundi agrees and nominates Obi-Wan to go. With the nomination agreed on, the Council adjourns and Obi-Wan prepares to go to Utapau. Yoda,
Luminara Unduli
, and
Gree
, along with
Tarfful
and
Chewbacca
defend Kashyyyk against the Corporate Alliance Tanks, Dwarf Spider droids, Droid Gunships, and legions of
battle droids
.
Obi-Wan vs. Grievous
"
Army or not, you must realize… you are doomed!
"
"
Oh, I don't think so.
"
―Grievous and Obi-Wan Kenobi
[

Grievous twirls his four sabers as the battle commences.
Anakin walks Obi-Wan to a Jedi cruiser before he leaves. Anakin still believes he'd be needed on Utapau, and while Obi-Wan agrees, he also notes it might just be a wild
Bantha
chase. Anakin stops Obi-Wan and tells him that he knows he's disappointed Obi-Wan and that he's not been acting very grateful for the training he received. Anakin tells him he's just been so frustrated with the Council lately, but that he does apologize. Obi-Wan calls Anakin strong and wise and tells Anakin he's very proud of him and while Obi-Wan trained him since Anakin was a boy, he calls Anakin a far greater Jedi than Obi-Wan could hope to be. But Obi-Wan encourages Anakin to be patient and that it won't be long before the Council makes Anakin a
Jedi Master
. The two bid each other farewell and Obi-Wan leaves for Utapau. Little do they know that this is the last time they will see or speak to each other as fellow Jedi and friends.
Obi-Wan arrives in
Pau City
on Utapau, and begins his search for General Grievous, riding a
varactyl
named
Boga
. He finds Grievous on the Tenth Level. After Obi-Wan dispatches the droids around Grievous, the two engage in single combat. Grievous's arms split in half, allowing him to use four lightsabers at once. Obi-Wan quickly cuts off the lower halves of the General's hands, helping to even out the odds a little. During the battle, the
Third Systems Army
arrives under the command of
CC-2224
"Cody." Obi-Wan manages to catch Grievous off guard and uses the Force to push the fiendish droid general into the ceiling. Grievous drops his remaining two lightsabers and attempts to flee on his
wheel bike
, while Obi-Wan pursues on
Boga
. During the chase, Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber, which
Commander
Cody happens to find during the massive battle against the droids.
On Coruscant, Anakin tells Palpatine that General Grievous has been found on Utapau. Anakin insists he should be on Utapau as well. Their conversation shifts to Palpatine's knowledge of the Force and dark side, both of which he learned from his mentor (Plagueis), much to the shock of Anakin who starts to become wary of the Chancellor. After Palpatine tells him that the dark side can save Padme from death, Anakin realizes that Palpatine is in fact Darth Sidious, the latter of which Palpatine confirms (This revelation means that Palpatine as Sidious engineered the
Invasion of Naboo
and War, betrayed and caused the deaths of Plagueis and Dooku, and has been deceiving the Jedi and Republic). Anakin ignites his lightsaber and threatens to kill Palpatine, but then decides to expose his deception and identity to the Jedi Council. He is still concerned with saving his wife, and believes only Palpatine's knowledge will ensure this.
Obi-Wan continues to chase General Grievous on Utapau. He catches up with the General and jumps onto his wheel bike. Using Grievous's electrostaff, he manages to destabilize the speeder, and it goes into a spin. Both Obi-Wan and Grievous are thrown off as the speeder topples over the edge of Grievous's secret landing platform. Grievous then draws his
blaster
, though it is knocked from his hand by Obi-Wan, now wielding the electrostaff. He knocks Grievous down, and a brawl ensues, during which Kenobi tears open the General's chest plates, revealing his living organs. Enraged, Grievous repeatedly hits Obi-Wan and then picks up the helpless Jedi and throws him over the edge. Obi-Wan barely manages to hang on and momentarily dangles for his life. As Grievous moves in for the kill, Obi-Wan uses the Force to retrieve the General's blaster and fires at Grievous's exposed organs. He hits, and they burst into flames. With his eyes flaming, Grievous falls to the floor, dead.
Sidious revealed
"
In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you're under arrest, Chancellor.

"
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

"
The Senate will decide your fate.

"Not yet.

It's treason, then.

Palpatine finally reveals his identity as the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious.
Anakin returns to the Jedi Temple and approaches Windu who tells Anakin that they have just been informed that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous and so they are going to go to the Senate to ensure that Chancellor Palpatine gives back his emergency powers. However, Anakin reveals that Palpatine is a Sith Lord and is not likely to give up his powers, a statement which shocks Windu and stops him dead in his tracks. Anakin confirms what he just said and says he believes Palpatine is the one they have been looking for. When Windu asks how Anakin knows this, he tells Windu that Palpatine knows the ways of the Force and has been trained to use the dark side and that he is absolutely sure. Windu says their worst fears have now been realized and that if the Jedi Order is to survive, they must move quickly. Anakin warns Windu that Palpatine is very powerful and they'll need his help to arrest Palpatine, but Windu urges him to stay out of it as he senses much fear in Anakin and it could cloud his judgment. Windu also adds that if what Anakin says is true then Anakin will have gained his trust but for now, he wants Anakin to wait in the Council Chambers until he returns. Masters Windu,
Kit Fisto
,
Agen Kolar
, and
Saesee Tiin
board a
gunship
and head to Palpatine's office.
Sitting in the
Council Chambers
, remembering Palpatine's promise of stopping death and the dreams of Padmé dying in childbirth, Anakin ruminates over his decision: in his mind, he hears Palpatine's voice saying that if the Jedi kill him, any chance of saving Padmé will be lost. Finally, he leaves and rushes after the four Jedi.
Windu and the three other Jedi Masters arrive at Chancellor Palpatine's office. Windu declares Palpatine is under arrest and the Masters ignite their lightsabers. Sidious pulls a lightsaber from his sleeve and hurls himself at the Jedi with a screeching war cry. Kolar is the first to die, run through the chest and as Kolar's life is ending due to the wound, Sidious turns and slices Tiin's torso. A few seconds later, with more effort from Sidious, Fisto is slain, killed by a slash across the gut. Only Windu remains, alone against the Dark Lord.
Rise of Lord Vader

Sidious'
face becomes disfigured by his backfired
Force lightning
.
Sidious and Windu continue the fight, dueling fiercely. The fight appears to be even early on, but Windu gradually gains ground, slowly driving the Sith Lord out of the Chancellor's antechamber and into the office proper. Shortly after the two shatter a large glass window, Windu delivers a kick to Sidious, leading to Sidious falling down and losing his lightsaber. Anakin arrives just as Windu holds Sidious at blade point. Windu declares Sidious has lost, but the Sith Lord then unleashes a torrent of
Force lightning
. However, Windu deflects it with his blade, casting much of the energy back into Sidious' body. Sidious becomes hideously deformed; his face becomes deathly pale and sagged, his teeth become yellow and rotten, his fingernails become long and dirty, and his eyes turn burning yellow with blood-red rims. He then ends his assault, claiming he is too weak to fight on. As Windu is deciding to kill Sidious, Anakin argues that Palpatine must stand trial: Windu disregards this, stating Sidious's control over the Senate and courts make him too dangerous to be left alive. Anakin is finally forced to choose between the Jedi Order or Padmé. As Windu is about to deliver the killing blow, Anakin betrays Windu and cuts off his sword arm. Sidious, cackling with glee, tortures and blasts the shocked Windu out of the window, sending him plunging to his death hundreds of stories below.
Anakin is horrified by his actions, yet he knows now there is no turning back now that he betrayed the Jedi. He pledges allegiance to Sidious, in return for the Dark Lord's power to stop death, in the hope of saving his beloved wife. Sidious takes Anakin as his Sith apprentice, bestowing upon him the
Sith
name "Darth Vader." Sidious instructs Vader launch
Operation: Knightfall
, to ensure the so-called Jedi Rebellion is crushed, and then wipe out the Separatist Council on the
Mustafar system
, before declaring that "
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy
."
Vader leads the
501st Legion
to the Jedi Temple. He and the clones rampage through the Temple, cutting down every Jedi that crosses his path, including swordsmaster
Cin Drallig
and even the
younglings
hiding out in the Council Chamber.

calling for all Jedi to return to Coruscant, knowing that it's really a trap set by Darth Sidious. Kenobi hopes to instead warn any surviving Jedi to stay away from the Temple.
Following the attack on the Jedi Temple, Vader returns to Padmé at the Senate Apartment Complex, from where the smoke rising from the wrecked Temple can be seen. He tells her the Jedi have tried to take over the Republic, and there are traitors in the Senate. He asks for her loyalty to the Chancellor, then tells her that he will go to the Mustafar system, where the remaining Separatists have gathered, to end the war.
Through a hologram, Sidious informs the Separatist Council that Vader would take care of them once he arrived, though the council is unaware that Sidious had betrayed them and truly sent Vader to kill them.

Vader arrives on Mustafar and is greeted by
Viceroy
Gunray, but the Sith apprentice quickly traps the Separatist Council in the bunker. He slaughters Poggle the Lesser,
Rune Haako
,
Po Nudo
, and Wat Tambor among others. He leaves Gunray until last, slicing the Neimoidian across the chest even as he pleads for his life. It is at this point that the first physical manifestation of the dark side in Vader begins to show itself, as his irises turn a pallid yellow, the rest of his eyes taking on a bright crimson hue.
The Senate holds a special session where Palpatine tells them of the "plot of the Jedi to overthrow the Senate," but that it was foiled. Amidst thunderous applause, he informs the Senate that the surviving Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. He then states that "in order to ensure the security and continued stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first
Galactic Empire
," which Palpatine describes as creating a safe and secure society. As the majority of the Senate screams their approval, Padmé Amidala and Bail Organa, who are shocked at the result, simply look around and Padmé can only remark "So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause."
The

In the meantime, Obi-Wan and Yoda go to the Jedi Temple, slaying several clones and walking in disbelief through the carnage. Yoda notices that several of their fellow Jedi were cut down by a foe wielding a lightsaber. They recalibrate the Temple's signal to warn all surviving Jedi to keep away from the Temple, but then Obi-Wan, wanting to know the truth, checks the security hologram recordings. To his horror, one recording shows Vader dueling Younglings and then kneeling before Sidious. Yoda says they must destroy the Sith, but Obi-Wan is reluctant to kill Anakin and wants to go after the Emperor instead. Yoda, however, states that Obi-Wan is not strong enough to face Sidious and that Anakin is gone, "consumed" by Vader. Yoda sets out to confront Sidious, telling Obi-Wan to "use his feelings" to find Vader.
Following Yoda's advice, Obi-Wan visits Padmé asking where Anakin is and tells her that he has turned to the dark side and killed many Jedi in the temple, and also that everyone was deceived by Sidious who was behind everything which includes the war. Despite her anguish, Padmé refuses to reveal where her husband has gone. Obi-Wan deduces that Padmé is carrying Anakin's child, who already knew the two had been together all along and apologizes to her for what he had no choice to do before leaving. On Mustafar, Vader surveys the violent landscape around him and weeps over his recent acts of violence; knowing he cannot turn back from the influence of Darth Sidious.
Later, Padmé leaves Coruscant in her star skiff, departing for Mustafar to find her husband and the truth. Unknown to her, Obi-Wan secretly stows away aboard the ship just before it takes off.
Battle of the heroes
"
You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!
"
"
I hate you!
"
"
You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you!
"
―Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader

Darth Sidious and
Yoda
, masters of
the Force
, battle each other.
The star skiff lands on Mustafar, and Padmé is greeted by a smiling Vader. Padmé reveals her conversation with Obi-Wan; he tells her it is only lies but does not deny the accusations. Padmé also tells him Obi-Wan knew about them together, wanting to help them & begs him to run away with her to raise their child in peace. Vader, mad with power, claims that they no longer have to run away and he can overthrow Palpatine so that the two of them can rule the galaxy together. Padmé, realizing how much her husband has changed, backs away in horror and tearfully begs him to stop, insisting she still loves him.
As she pleads, Obi-Wan steps out onto the star skiff's boarding ramp. Upon seeing him, Vader becomes enraged and accuses Padmé betraying him for Obi-Wan. Without even allowing her a chance to explain herself, he begins
Force-choking
her. Obi-Wan intervenes and demands Vader to release Padmé, but Vader still chokes her unconscious. Turning his anger on Obi-Wan, Vader accuses him of turning his wife against him, but Obi-Wan retorts that Vader has done that himself and let himself be twisted by Sidious' lies, becoming a Sith. Vader refuses to listen and rants that he has brought order to his "new empire." Obi-Wan, unable to believe what he is hearing, prepares to fight. Vader fumes that those who are against him are his enemies and engages Obi-Wan in a
ferocious duel
between Master and Apprentice.
Obi-Wan and his fallen apprentice battling on
Mustafar
.
In the
Chancellor's office
within the
Imperial Senate Building
, Yoda confronts Palpatine. He tells him that he knows of Anakin's turning, while addressing him as his Sith name. Sidious uses Force Lightning to push the Jedi Master backwards into a pillar. Obi-Wan and Vader battle over the bridge and enter the
Klegger Corp Mining Facility
, making their way through the hallways. Returning to
Coruscant
, Sidious tells Yoda that the Jedi will be no more. The Jedi master stands up and pushes him backwards past the desk. They engage in an
intense battle
using their lightsabers and Force abilities. At the Mustafarian Mining Complex, Obi-Wan and Vader battle in the conference room on the desk. Vader attempts to force choke the Jedi Master with the enabled lightsaber. Obi-Wan loses it after getting kicked in the stomach, but he retrieves it. Yoda resumes fighting Sidious until they are taken the
Galactic Senate Chamber
, the heart of the Senate. Vader is still battling Obi-Wan, who is on the defensive. They fight at the command center with the dead Separatist leaders on the floor. A missed slash from Vader's lightsaber damages a computer console, deactivating the facility's shields. As the door opens, Obi-Wan and Vader exit the mining facility and head outside. At the Galactic Senate Chamber, Sidious hurls Senate pods at Yoda, and the effort to avoid them exhausts the Jedi Master. Sidious then blasts Yoda with Force Lightning, causing the Jedi master to lose his lightsaber. With the last of his strength, Yoda redirects it back at him, but this causes an explosion that throws both himself and Sidious over the edge of the pod.
Obi-Wan and Vader's battle continue on as they tip-toe across some pipes. A Mustafarian
mining droid
briefly passes by them. The pair jump onto a bridge and walk onto some large stalks. At the same time, lava begins to erupt towards Vader and Obi-Wan, forcing them to take cover from raining debris. The lava cuts off a collection arm attached to the main structure. Sidious is able to hold on to a senate pod, while Yoda falls to the senate floor leaving his cloak behind. With Bail Organa's help, Yoda flees the Senate Building, intending to go into exile. Back on Mustafar, the rest of the battle resumes. Obi-Wan and Vader ride the collection arm down the lava river below, which falls over a molten waterfall. Abandoning the arm, Obi-Wan leaps onto a hovering mining platform below, with Vader pursuing him back up the lava river atop a collection droid. Obi-Wan appeals to his old friend one last time, but Vader still refuses to see reason, forcing Obi-Wan to accept that his student, friend, and brother is corrupted beyond redemption.
After fending off another attack from Vader, Obi-Wan disengages as the platform nears the shore of the lava river, leaping up onto the black sand bank. Obi-Wan warns Vader that he now holds an unassailable position, but Vader, enraged and bloodthirsty, yells "You underestimate my power!" and foolishly leaps up to kill his old Master the same way Obi-Wan ended Maul. With a swift sweep of his blade, Obi-Wan slices off Vader's left arm and legs. Vader tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop at the edge of the river of lava.
As Obi-Wan watches, Vader, helpless and now fully consumed by the dark side, tries in vain to pull his crippled, smoking body up the embankment with his one remaining mechanical arm. Obi-Wan is overcome with disgust and sadness at the pitiful fate of "The Chosen One," and is reduced nearly to tears. He angrily shouts that Vader has failed in his life and destiny, and has hurt all those who loved him, including Obi-Wan himself. All Vader can do is scream in pain and powerless rage, cursing his former friend and Master. The lava below Vader then ignites his leg, setting him on fire, horribly burning and disfiguring him, with Obi-Wan turning away from the terror, unwilling to kill him. After briefly staring at the charred, mutilated figure that was once Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan turns and walks away, taking Anakin's dropped lightsaber with him. He returns to the star skiff and leaves the planet with the unconscious Padmé and her droids. Obi-Wan feels guilt for failing Anakin & Padmé's happiness.
Birth and rebirth
"
Obi-Wan, there is good in him. I know...I know there is… still…
"
―Padmé Amidala to Obi-Wan Kenobi as her final words.

Sidious arrives on Mustafar with a group of
shock troopers
led by Commander
Thire
. They rescue Darth Vader from the edge of death using a stasis pod and Sith medicines held in the Emperor's
shuttle
.
On the isolated asteroid
Polis Massa
, Yoda meditates and hears the spirit voice of
Qui-Gon Jinn
. The voice tells him that there is a way to merge with the Force and retain consciousness after death. In order to learn this power, Yoda declares himself an apprentice to the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn.
The remains of Vader's limbs are retrofitted with
prosthetics
.
Obi-Wan arrives at Polis Massa with Padmé, who is given emergency medical treatment by the facility's droids. She is dying, having lost the will to live. The
medical droids
work to save her babies—she has twins, much to the surprise of Bail Organa, Obi-Wan, and Yoda. A boy and a girl are born. In her last few dying breaths, Padmé gives them the names "
Luke
" and "
Leia
."
As his children are born, Vader is being rebuilt at the
Grand Republic Medical Facility
on Coruscant. Vader is given new legs, a new arm, mechanized lungs, and other "replacement parts." He is dressed in
black armor
, a face mask is sealed tightly, and his helmet is fitted. Darth Vader begins to breathe through his mask. Most, if not the entire surgery is carried out in true dark-side form, with Vader wide awake and apparently unanesthetized, leaving him moaning, screaming, and writhing in excruciating agony.
With Padmé's final breath, she maintains that there is still good in Anakin. She dies still believing in the man she loved, before his violent acts against the
Jedi Order
and the
Separatist Council
. Obi-Wan watches her go sadly.
Vader is raised to a standing position, his surgery complete. Vader begins to speak through his
vocabulator
to the Emperor, asking about Padmé. Sidious, seeking to cut Vader's last tie to his old life and permanently cement the dark side in his heart, lies to Vader, telling him that he accidentally killed his wife while Force choking her. With his last shred of hope and love now gone and his mind broken by the realization that he himself killed the person he wanted to save, Vader rips himself free of the operating table and unleashes a powerful scream of rage, shame, and grief through the Force, shattering the droids and equipment. Vader screams "Nooo!" in anger and despair, while the Emperor looks on with an evil grin.

For their own safety, Luke and Leia will be split up in hopes that the Sith will not sense their presence. Leia will be adopted by Bail Organa, and Luke would be sent to his father's
step family
on
Tatooine
. Obi-Wan and Yoda will watch and wait until the time is ready for the Skywalker children to do their part. Yoda tells Obi-Wan to study the technique Qui-Gon learned to achieve immortality.

Development
One piece of concept art Lucas approved for use as a starship in the film was described as a "Republic Clone Sky Fighter", but the ship ultimately was not included in the film. The design was later reused years later for the
Star Wars: The High Republic
multimedia initiative, much to the joy of its creator,
Warren Fu
. Fu is also notable for creating the concept art for the "Droid General" character who evolved into Grievous. One of his previous Grievous designs was used for the MagnaGuards.

Release and reception
Revenge of the Sith
charity premieres took place in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston, Denver, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Miami on Thursday,
May 12
,
2005
; and on
May 13
, 2005, there were two additional charity premiere screenings in George Lucas's hometown of Modesto. On that same day, an episode of
MTV's
Total Request Live
aired promoting the movie, featuring a performance from the band
Good Charlotte
.
[
7
]
The film's official premiere was at the Cannes Film Festival (out of competition) on May 15, 2005. It was released in most other countries on May 19. It was predicted that the premiere of
Revenge of the Sith
would cost the US economy approximately $627 million USD because of employees who would take the day off or report in sick.
[
8
]
Due to its dark undertones, disaster scenes and violent nature (mainly the scene where Anakin is burned alive in a rather graphic and realistic manner, as well as Dooku's decapitation and Grievous' internal organs being burned out),
Revenge of the Sith
is the first
Star Wars
film to receive a
PG-13
rating from the
MPAA
. All previously released films in the series were rated PG. In contrast,
A New Hope
was originally rated G, but its rating was deliberately pushed up in order to attract a broader audience and because of the addition of Owen and Beru Lars' remains.
Continuity
In the DVD commentary for
Revenge of the Sith
, Lucas makes an offhand comment regarding the
Death Star
seen in the final moments of the film. He explains that it was exactly the same one as seen in
A New Hope
, and goes on to say that it would be "a bit of a stretch," but explains that due to "union disputes and supply problems," it took 19 years to build. The
canon
novel
Tarkin
by
James Luceno
, set five years after
Revenge of the Sith
, explores some aspects of the construction of the Death Star. The book
Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel
, also written by James Luceno, went into more detail about how the Republic secretly began the project and how it continued to expand under the Empire's direction.
Thrawn
and
Thrawn: Treason
also show some aspects of the production and supply issues of the Death Star. The movie
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
sheds further light on the construction of the Death Star, as it depicts how the
Rebel Alliance
came to have the
Death Star plans
.
Within the Legends continuity,
Kevin J. Anderson
's novels
Jedi Search
and
Champions of the Force
explain that a prototype Death Star was built in preparation for the construction of the first Death Star in
A New Hope
. These conflicting accounts were retconned in
The New Essential Chronology
, which stated that the former was a testbed prototype for the
superlaser
to be installed on the latter. The
Chronology
also mentions the fact that in order to ensure protection from sabotage, the construction site was moved to various locations throughout the nineteen-year gap between
Revenge of the Sith
and
A New Hope
, indicating that there were various attempts by unknown persons to disable or even destroy the massive battle station, a theory supported by a line from
A New Hope
where Vader proclaims that "There will be no one to stop us this time" in regard to the Death Star and its plans. The another Legends novels
The Dark Nest Trilogy
, written by
Troy Denning
, explore the continuity pieces about the holographic recordings of Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan in R2's memory banks. Although the
Skywalker family
saga comes full circle,
Luke Skywalker
and
Leia Organa
still don't know their mother's identity, but Luke has stumbled on a memory of R2-D2's that contains her image, even he watches a hologram of Anakin Force-choking Padmé, as well as his and Leia's birth. Denning shows Artoo's desire to hide these recordings from Luke – no doubt feeling he will learn something hurtful – while couching it in the fact that the astromech droid has developed quirks in his circuitry.
The Legends video game
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed
revealed that Galen Marek greatly damaged the Death Star while infiltrating the station to rescue Rebel leaders. This was held to be a partial explanation for why it took so long to build the Death Star as well as Vader's line "There will be no one to stop us this time."
Adaptations and tie-in media
A
novelization
of the film was written by
Matthew Stover
. It includes much more dialogue than the movie. The duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin is lengthened and is much more exaggerated. It also contains many references to
Expanded Universe
characters, such as
Raith Sienar
or
Garm Bel Iblis
, for example, and some details, like the way
Shaak Ti
meets her fate, and Captain
Needa's
appearance at the Battle of Coruscant differ from their movie counterparts. Aside from Anakin and Obi-Wan's duel, however, the final act is very compressed, especially in comparison to the opening space battle, which encompasses the first third of the book.
Dark Horse Comics
published a
comic adaptation
of the film in March 2005. Other books include the prequel novel
Labyrinth of Evil
and the sequel novel
Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader
.
A
video game based on the film
was released on
May 5
, 2005, two weeks before the film. The game followed the movie's storyline, for the most part, integrating scenes from the movie. However, many sections of the game featured cut scenes from the movie or entirely new scenes for the game. The style of the game was mostly lightsaber combat and fighting as Obi-Wan or Anakin/Vader. One unique and popular aspect of the game was that it included an alternate ending, which functioned as such to both the game and the movie, which involved Obi-Wan warning Vader about having the high ground, to which Vader leaps and dodges Obi-Wan's attempted
Mou kei
and subsequently stabs his former master in the back, killing him. After his death, Vader kicks Obi-Wan's lifeless corpse down the black sand bank, grins, and walks off, as Palpatine arrives on Mustafar to congratulate Vader on his victory. Vader proceeds towards Sidious' docked shuttle, and the new emperor declares the galaxy to belong to the both of them and gives Vader his new, red-bladed lightsaber. After quickly examining his new lightsaber, Vader ignites it and impales his Sith master, declaring the galaxy to belong only to him.
The film's
soundtrack
was released by Sony Classical on
May 3
, 2005—more than two weeks before the release of the film. The music was composed and conducted by
John Williams
, and performed by the
London Symphony Orchestra
and
London Voices
. A music video titled
A Hero Falls
was created for the film's theme "
Battle of the Heroes
," featuring footage from the film.
Home video
Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
was released on DVD on
November 1
,
2005
(in Canada and the United States). The DVD was a two-disc set that has picture and sound mastered from the original digital source material. It includes a new full-length documentary as well as two featurettes, one which explores the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker as the Chosen One, the other looking at the movie's stunts. The 15-part web documentary series "Making Episode III" and a playable
Xbox
demo of
Star Wars: Battlefront II
(which was released simultaneously with the DVD) were also included in the set.
The release was the first
Star Wars
film (and the first major film of all time) never to be widely released on VHS (for example, it
was
released on VHS in Australia). This caused some backlash from fans collecting both the DVD and VHS versions, who complained that their VHS set was not complete without Episode III. Both the DVD and VHS versions had only one alteration from the film's digital theatrical cut; A straight cut replaced a wipe between the scene where Obi-Wan leaves Mustafar and the scene where Vader climbs away from the lava. (The wipe was reinstated for the Blu-ray release.)

Reception
‡
In interviews, George Lucas said that George Bush was not an influence in writing the movie. Rather, he wrote the basic story outline in the 1970s during the Vietnam War, thinking of President Richard Nixon.
[
18
]
He stated at Cannes, "The parallels between what we did in Vietnam and what we're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable."
[

Lucas added that in more general terms, his story represents how any democracy can turn into a dictatorship with the consent of the people, like Caesar of Rome and Napoleon I of France.

Popular reception
In the era of the internet,
Revenge of the Sith

hello there
," has arisen to one of the most famous
Star Wars
memes
[

and has been referenced in official works,

Deleted scenes
‡
Six deleted scenes were included on Disc 2 of the DVD:
"Grievous Slaughters Shaak Ti" - The death of
Shaak Ti
by
General
Grievous
on board the
Invisible Hand
. Deleted due to time constraints, and because the story was changed that Grievous left Shaak Ti on Coruscant alive, and she didn't die.
"A Stirring in the Senate" - The First Meeting of the
Rebel Alliance
. Deleted because it took away from the central plot of Anakin Skywalker.
"Seeds of Rebellion" - The Second Meeting of the Rebel Alliance. Deleted because it took away from the central plot of Anakin Skywalker.
"Confronting the Chancellor" - The Presentation of the
Delegation of 2000
to
Palpatine
. Deleted because it took away from the central plot of Anakin Skywalker.
"A Plot to Destroy the Jedi?" -
Mace Windu
senses the destruction of the
Jedi Order
. Deleted due to time constraints and because the point was already known.
"Exiled to Dagobah" - Yoda lands on
Dagobah
. Deleted for fear it would clutter up the endings instead of making it just "father, mother, and the kids." Rick McCallum is quoted as saying that this was the biggest loss for him to the film and he hopes to see it on a future edition.
Other scenes were also cut from the film:
Obi-Wan
visits Senator Amidala to discuss
Anakin
, and tell her that he knows of her marriage. This scene features in the script, novel and comic book adaptation of the film, albeit differing slightly in each.
Obi-Wan selects

The clone asks the creature if anything is there. "Wookiee good, eat Wookiee," replies the creature. The clone decides it is just a native
Kashyyyk
creature and decides to leave. Immediately, Chewbacca jumps out of the water and pulls the clone underwater, killing him. Then Tarfful wakes up and the creature reveals itself to be Yoda. He tells the Wookiees to give him a second to bathe. Yoda jumps into the water and scrubs all the mud off. Yoda emerges and puts on his robes. They then continue towards the emergency escape pod.
A scene in which Yoda speaks to the voice of

Most of the lead cast
George Lucas
makes a cameo appearance at the
Galaxies Opera House
. He is the blue-faced being, named
Baron
Papanoida
, seen just outside Palpatine's private box. It marks Lucas's first and only appearance in any of the
Star Wars
films. His three children also have cameos: Jett as a young Jedi-in-training called
Zett Jukassa
at the
Jedi Temple
, his daughter Amanda as a senator called
Terr Taneel
, and Katie as a blue-skinned alien senator called
Chi Eekway Papanoida
, visible when Palpatine arrives at the Senate after being saved by the Jedi.
Much of the crew make cameos in the film. For example
Nick Gillard
, the stunt coordinator, plays a character named
Cin Drallig
(his name spelled backwards, omitting the
k
).
Rick McCallum
's daughter
Mousy
plays one of the Padawans killed by Darth Vader, named
Bene
. Visual effects supervisor
John Knoll
played the Coruscant firefighter pilot. When Palpatine, Anakin, and Obi-Wan are falling down the elevator shaft in the beginning of the movie, it is John Knoll's hand that grabs the wire, not
Hayden Christensen
's. Also in the movie was
Jeremy Bulloch
(
Boba Fett
in the
original trilogy
), who played
Captain
Jeremoch Colton
, the pilot of the
CR70 corvette
, and later CR90 Rebel Blockade Runner,
Tantive III
. This was a speaking role. A number of Lucasfilm and ILM employees also made cameo appearances on the balconies of the Galaxies Opera House, while on the steps
Anthony Daniels
reprised his Episode II cameo as
Dannl Faytonni
.
