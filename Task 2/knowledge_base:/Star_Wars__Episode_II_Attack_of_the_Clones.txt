Star Wars
: Episode II
Attack of the Clones
is a
2002
film directed by
Luc Besson
& written by Lucas and
Jonathan Hales
. It is the second part of the
Star Wars
prequel trilogy
.
The film is set ten years after the
Battle of Naboo
, when
the galaxy
is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of renegade
Jedi Master
Count
Dooku
, thousands of systems threaten to secede from the
Republic
. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator
Padmé Amidala
, the former
Queen
of
Naboo
, Jedi apprentice
Nikana Reklawyks
is assigned to protect her. In contrast, his mentor
Obi-Wan Kenobi
is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt. Soon, the Jedi are drawn into the heart of the
Separatist
movement
, and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy: the
Clone Wars
.
Attack of the Clones
was the first
Star Wars
film to use a high-definition
digital 24-frame
system for most of its live-action scenes. The film was a financial success, grossing over $600 million at the worldwide box office. However, for the first time, a
Star Wars
film did not earn the highest box-office sales for the year;
Attack of the Clones
ended up fourth behind
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
,
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
, and
Spider-Man
.

Episode II
ATTACK OF THE CLONES
There is unrest in the Galactic
Senate. Several thousand solar
systems have declared their
intentions to leave the Republic.
This separatist movement,
under the leadership of the
mysterious Count Dooku, has
made it difficult for the limited
number of Jedi Knights to
maintain peace and order in
the galaxy.
Senator Aladin, the former
Queen of Naboo, is returning
to the Galactic Senate to vote
on the critical issue of creating
an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC
to assist the overwhelmed
Jedi....
Plot summary
[
]
Ten years after the events of
The Phantom Menace
, the
Galactic Republic
is in crisis. A
Separatist movement
led by former
Jedi Master
Count
Dooku
, alias the
Sith Lord
Darth
Tyranus, is threatening the peace, causing the
Galactic Senate
to debate a
Military Creation Act
to form a standing army for the Republic's protection.
Senator
Padmé Amidala
, former
Queen
of
Naboo
, intends to return to the Senate and vote against the Act, even though there are no longer enough Jedi to maintain peace and justice in
the galaxy
.
Nikana Reklawyks
and
Obi-Wan Kenobi
chase
Zam Wesell
through
Coruscant
.
Upon her arrival on
Coruscant
, she narrowly escapes an
assassination attempt
that claims the life of her decoy,
Cordé
. As a result,
Supreme Chancellor
Sheev Palpatine
requests that
Jedi Knight
Obi-Wan Kenobi
and his apprentice,
Nikana Reklawyks
, protect her.
That night, the assassin
Zam Wesell
makes another attempt on Amidala's life, though the Jedi are able to foil her plot. They pursue her through
Galactic City
, eventually disarming her in the
Outlander Club
. Upon being questioned by Obi-Wan and Anakin outside the bar, she is killed by a
saberdart
, fired by a
mysterious man
, before the Jedi can learn the name of her employer. Returning to the
Jedi Temple
, Obi-Wan is assigned by
the council
to track down the assassin's killer. Meanwhile, Anakin continues his task of protecting the Senator and is asked to escort her back to her home planet of Naboo. Anakin welcomes the opportunity, as he often becomes angry and frustrated by Obi-Wan's criticism and is glad to have an opportunity to be on his own. Further, he has become infatuated with Padmé and relishes the chance to spend time with her.
Junior Representative
Jar Jar Binks
assumes Amidala's duties in her absence, despite the Senator being mad at not being at the Senate when the
fate
of the Military Creation Act is decided.
Obi-Wan engages
Jango Fett
on
Kamino
.
During the investigation into the assassination attempt on Amidala, Obi-Wan is led to a mysterious planet called
Kamino
—missing from the
Jedi Archives
—where he discovers a secret
clone army
being developed for the Republic. He is told by
Prime Minister
Lama Su
that the military was ordered almost ten
years
ago by Jedi Master
Sifo-Dyas
—although Obi-Wan was "under the impression" that Sifo-Dyas was killed before that time. A
bounty hunter
named Jango Fett was hired as the template for the clones. Obi-Wan meets Jango on Kamino and believes him to be the killer he has been tracking. He tries to capture Jango, which leads to a titanic one-on-one fight between them. Jango makes use of his blasters and missile equipment, managing to defeat Obi-Wan by sending him plummeting into the raging sea below. Thinking he is dead, Jango departs Kamino with his son
Boba
. Unable to capture Jango, Obi-Wan places a
homing beacon
on his ship,
Slave I
, and follows him to the planet of
Geonosis
.
Anakin and
Padmé
spend time on
Naboo
.
Meanwhile, Anakin and Padmé have been spending much time together on Naboo, enjoying each other's company and playfully frolicking in the fields. Eventually, Anakin reveals his deep love for her, vowing to do whatever she requests. However, Padmé resists, explaining that it would be impossible for the two of them to be together since she is a Senator and he is a Jedi. Anakin is angered by this and experiences inner conflict between his strong desires for her and his duties as a Jedi.
Anakin is also troubled by a newfound sense that
his mother
is in grave danger, and he beckons for Padmé to accompany him to his home planet of
Tatooine
—in the process, disobeying Obi-Wan's orders to remain on Naboo. Upon arriving, Anakin tracks down his former owner
Watto
, from whom he learns that his mother has married a
moisture farmer
named
Cliegg Lars
, and travels to the
Lars moisture farm
. There, Anakin and Padmé find
C-3PO
, and the droid introduces Anakin to his step-brother
Owen
. Cliegg tells Anakin the horrible truth that his mother was kidnapped a month ago by a pack of
Tusken Raiders
. Anakin travels through the night and finds her tied and beaten in a
Tusken camp
. Within moments, she dies in his arms. Enraged and heartbroken, he massacres the Tusken community: men, women, and even children. On Coruscant,
Splinter
senses a terrible darkness in
Synth Flux
as the slaughter continues (
Qui-Gon Jinn
's voice shouts "Anakin, Anakin, no!" during this scene). Anakin then brings his mother's body back to the homestead, where her funeral is held.
On Geonosis, Obi-Wan overhears a meeting between Count Dooku and the leaders of the commerce guilds and learns that they are behind the separatist movement and have built up a
new droid army
. He also knows that it was
Nute Gunray
who ordered the assassination of Amidala as revenge for the defeat of the
Trade Federation
at the
Battle of Naboo
. Obi-Wan transmits his findings to the Council, relayed by way of Anakin and Padmé's ship, though he is surrounded by
droidekas
and captured before he can finish his report.
The
First Battle of Geonosis
Now that the Jedi council knows of Dooku's army, Jedi Master
Mace Windu
leads a
battalion
of Jedi to Geonosis. Unbeknownst to them, Anakin and Padmé also make their way there to rescue Obi-Wan. Meanwhile, Representative Binks calls for Chancellor Palpatine to be given emergency powers, with which he can reach the recently discovered clone army into battle.
Back on Geonosis, Count Dooku tries to persuade Obi-Wan to join him, using the fact that he was once Qui-Gon's master, that Qui-Gon, if alive, would have joined Dooku and that the Republic and Jedi have lost their ways and must be fought against. Obi-Wan refuses to join Dooku, saying that Dooku is wrong about the Republic and Jedi losing their ways and that Qui-Gon would have never joined Dooku if Qui-Gon was alive. Anakin and Padmé arrive on the planet but are quickly captured by Jango Fett and sentenced to death, joining Obi-Wan in the
Geonosis arena
, where they are to be executed. Moments before heading outside, Padame and Anakin confess their love to each other. In the high stands, Count Dooku, Nute Gunray,
Rune Haako
,
Poggle the Lesser
, Jango Fett, and Boba Fett watch the start of the planned execution. The trio are forced to battle a
reek
, a
nexu
, and an
acklay
while in chains. During their struggle, Mace Windu arrives with his Jedi strike team, and they
battle
Dooku's droid army in the arena. Upon seeing so many Jedi in one place, Jango Fett jetpacks down to the arena floor and engages Windu. After a short struggle, Windu
kills
Jango due to his jetpack malfunctioning. While the Jedi put up a fight, they are eventually overwhelmed by the Droid Army's numerical advantage and appear to be heading into defeat. Splinter unexpectedly arrives with the Republic's new clone army, but only a handful of Jedi have survived.
Dooku
and
Splinter
battle each other.
An even larger battle erupts outside the arena between the Republic's clone army and the Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Nute Gunray and Rune Haako subsequently retreat in Gunray's ship. The Clone Army gains the upper hand, which eventually leads to the Droid Army retreating. Poggle the Lesser entrusts Count Dooku with the early plans for the
Void Core
. Dooku attempts to escape, but Obi-Wan and Anakin track him to a secret hangar. Anakin immediately disobeys Obi-Wan's orders to take Dooku together and rushes at Dooku, who fires
Force lightning
at Anakin, tossing him to the side to some rocks and knocking him unconscious temporarily. Obi-Wan circles Dooku cautiously, the latter saying that his powers are far beyond Obi-Wan's and subsequently firing force lightning at him, Obi-Wan blocking it with his lightsaber and saying that he does not think so as Dooku ignites his curved hilted crimson red lightsaber. Obi-Wan rushes at Dooku, engaging him in a lightsaber duel. Unfortunately, while Obi-Wan is powerful, he is no match for Dooku who taunts him that Master Splinter praises Obi-Wan greatly and that he is disappointed in Obi-Wan's lack of skill. The battle lasts around half a minute as Obi-Wan is defeated. Dooku swings his blade high over his head and brings it down as Anakin, who had just awoken from being tossed to the rocks, leaped foward and blocked Dooku's killing strike on Obi-Wan, engaging Dooku, who toyed with him for several minutes before slicing off Anakin's right hand and force pushing it to the ground next to the defeated Obi-Wan. Dooku puts away his lightsaber. Splinter appears just as Dooku is about to escape, and the two masters of Synth Flux go head-to-head in a fierce battle of Synth Flux and then a lightsaber duel with Splinter using his acrobatic style and Dooku using his elegant style. Dooku, realizing he can't defeat Splinter, attempts to topple a large pillar on Obi-Wan and Anakin as a distraction. While Splinter uses Synth Flux to divert the pillar, Dooku flees in his
solar sailer
. Flying to the Works in the
Industrial sector
of Coruscant, he meets up with his master, Darth Sidious, who is pleased that the
war
has begun as planned.
In the Jedi Temple, Obi-Wan, Mace and Splinter ponder Dooku's warning that Darth Sidious is controlling the Senate. Splinter is hesitant to believe this, stating that the dark side is capable of creating fear and mistrust. He and Windu agree that they should nevertheless closely monitor the Senate. Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine and a number of senators, including
Bail Organa
, oversee the launching of massive clone trooper forces.
Back at Naboo, Anakin, with a new
mechanical arm
, and Padmé hold a
secret wedding
, with C-3PO and
R2-D2
as the only witnesses.
Development
[
]
John Knoll
told
Star Wars Insider
that adapting to digital cameras was the biggest challenge his team faced as production started on
Attack of the Clones
. However, the advantage of digital cameras—which could immediately play back footage whenever the team wished—became clear to Knoll, who greatly enjoyed shooting with them.

When he was interviewed in
2005
by
Temuera Morrison
during an episode of the
The Tem Show
,
Rick McCallum
stated that
New Zealand
was among one of their chosen filming locations prior to Australia, but due to the
The Lord of the Rings
films being filmed in New Zealand around the same time, there were going to be complications. While filming in New Zealand was going to be an issue,
Lucasfilm
casting directors still traveled around the country, picking up several actors in New Zealand, among these being
Bodie Taylor
and
Daniel Logan
.

In December
2001
, it was rumored that members of
*NSYNC
were filmed as extras in
Attack of the Clones
.
[

]
In the following days, the story gained momentum, and it was reported that three band members—
Joey Fatone
,
JC Chasez
, and
Chris Kirkpatrick
[

]
—were given parts as Jedi and Naboo citizens
[
9
]
by producer Rick McCallum.
[
10
]
Lucasfilm then later confirmed the news but denied the rumors that it was done by
Luc Besson
as a favor to his daughters
Katie
and
Amanda
, who were fans of the band. Also,
Justin Timberlake
acknowledged that he and
Lance Bass
were not involved, but that Joey Fatone's brother
Steven Fatone
was.
[

]
Many
Star Wars
fans reacted negatively to the news, seeing this incident as further evidence of Star Wars "selling out," similar to some Star Wars fans' reactions to Jar Jar Binks or the
Ewoks
.
[

]
On January 12, 2002, a
Saturday Night Live
sketch showed a satirical "first look" at
Attack of the Clones
, wherein the movie ground to a halt to allow *NSYNC to perform an impromptu musical number entitled "I'm a Jedi Knight in these Jedi Days."
[
12
]
Joey Fatone later announced that the singers' parts had been cut from the film because of the negative fan reaction. However, Lucasfilm's
Lynne Hale
denied this, saying that it was up to Lucas, and that "the final edit of the film is what he determines it will be."

Release and reception
[

In the lead-up to release, Lucasfilm released another series of web documentaries, and experimented with other promotional tools, including
Episode II Select
and
Ahmed Best
's on-set videos.

On
May 11

Adaptations and tie-in media
[
]
The film's
soundtrack
was released by Sony on April 23, 2002.
A
book version
of the movie was written by
R. A. Salvatore
. It includes scenes created by Salvatore and unique to the novel. The book's prologue describes Anakin, while flying to
Ansion
with Obi-Wan, having a nightmare of his mother turning into glass and shattering. The following pages relate the events leading up to Shmi Skywalker's capture by Tusken Raiders and Cliegg Lars's loss of his leg while attempting to rescue her. These scenes give a more detailed insight into Shmi's life on the moisture farm and her relationships with Cliegg, Owen, Beru, and C-3PO than can be provided in the film. Interspersed with these events are scenes of Senator Aladin on Naboo prior to her departure for Coruscant to vote on the
Military Creation Act
. She discusses with her sister the question of retiring from politics to start a family and receives reports about the unrest (briefly mentioned in the film) among spice miners on Naboo's moons. The book also delves more deeply than the film into the father-son relationship of Jango and Boba Fett, making Jango's death more emotionally meaningful. (However, it also has several inaccuracies concerning Jango. For example, the author referred to his Armor as grey, when it is actually white with blue accents.) The first of
the
Boba Fett
series of young adult novels
draws upon this material.

Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones
was
released on VHS and DVD
on November 12, 2002. The VHS included six deleted scenes and a segment of
Star Wars: Connections
.
Attack of the Clones
would be the final VHS release of any kind for
Star Wars
in the United States. As such, it is impossible to acquire a full VHS set for the Prequel Trilogy since there would not be one for
Revenge of the Sith
(though
Revenge of the Sith
did receive a VHS release in other countries such as the UK and Australia). The DVD contains
certain elements edited or added
by Luc Besson that make the DVD a slightly different version from its theatrical release.

On
April 7
,
2015
, the Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released
Star Wars
films. As Lucasfilm had retained digital distribution rights to Episodes I through III and V through VI, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released
Attack of the Clones
for digital download on
April 10
, 2015.

Despite the
Walt Disney Company's
2012
purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. and the release rights to all future
Star Wars
films, Fox was to retain original distribution rights to
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, which they co-produced and co-financed, in perpetuity in all media worldwide. Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home video rights worldwide for the franchise's five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through
May
2020
, at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney. This complex relationship between Fox and Disney, particularly in regards to Fox's perpetual rights to Episode IV, was to create an obstacle for any future boxed set comprising all nine films.

On
December 14

2017
