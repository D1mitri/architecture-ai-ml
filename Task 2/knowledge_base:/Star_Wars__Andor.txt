"
Our world is exploding in different places right now, people's rights are disappearing, and
Andor
reflects that.
[In the show]
the Empire is taking over, and it feels like the same thing is happening in reality, too. I was impressed by Tony's social-realist intentions. He's created a whole new morality. It's very deep and humane—there is grief, mourning, hope, fear. It's not just primary colours here.

"
Going back to the
Star Wars
universe is very special for me. I have so many memories of the great work we did together and the relationships I made throughout the journey. We have a fantastic adventure ahead of us, and this new exciting format will give us the chance to explore this character more deeply.

―Diego Luna, on reprising his role
[

]
Talks for a television series focused on
Cassian Jeron Andor
,
Diego Luna
's character from the
2016
Star Wars
Anthology
film
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
, began before the Anthology film was released, though Luna had doubts that it would happen.
[

In
February
2018
, Disney CEO
Bob Iger
revealed that "a few"
Star Wars
live-action series were in development for
Disney's streaming service
.
[
15
]
The series was officially announced by Iger during a Disney quarterly earnings call on
November 8
, 2018.
[
1
]
A promotional banner for the series
On
November 30
, it was reported that
The Americans
executive producer
Stephen Schiff
was tapped to serve as a showrunner while
Moana
writer
Jared Bush
was revealed to have originated the project by writing a pilot script and a
series bible
.
[
16
]
According to
Production Weekly
, the series was scheduled to begin production in October
2019
.
[
17
]
On
July 11
, 2019,
Rick Famuyiwa
was reported to be in talks to direct an undisclosed amount of episodes for the series, with filming scheduled to begin on
October 7
.
[
18
]
On October 15, 2019, Variety reported that
Rogue One
co-writer
Tony Gilroy
would be writing the pilot for the series in addition to directing multiple episodes.
[
19
]
Lucasfilm's original concept for the series focused on the adventures of Andor and his reprogrammed
KX-series security droid
,
K-2SO
, who is played by
Alan Tudyk
. The two would have a
Butch and Sundance
style dynamic, with the two set to storm a citadel
[
20
]
in the series pilot.
[
21
]
Thanks to his work on
Rogue One
, Gilroy was consulted for work on the prequel series.
[
22
]
He thought the original pitch was "fine" but felt it was "very hard to sustain over a long haul,"
[
20
]
questioning what they could do after storming a citadel at the show's very start. Furthermore, he knew from his experience on
Rogue One
that K-2SO was a hard character to work with for long periods of time, which would make an entire series starring the character difficult, lest Lucasfilm wanted to have to find ways to hide him during many missions.
[
21
]
Tony Gilroy's pitch for
Andor
took the character of Cassian Andor back five years and followed him into "the worst night of his life."
Without outright saying he was interested, Gilroy responded with what was later called "a long forensic manifesto" to Lucasfilm, outlining his issues with the pitch and putting forth his own ideas. Gilroy's idea was the story that would become
Andor
,
[
20
]
pitching a story that took Andor himself "back five years, to the worst night of his life." In the process, the series would see Andor evolve into the man first seen in
Rogue One
. According to Gilroy, Lucasfilm thought his pitch "looked a little insane,"
[
22
]
and he fully admitted the story he had in mind was "a crazy idea" and "radical."
[
20
]
In the end, however, Lucasfilm decided Gilroy's story was the route to go.
[
22
]
Gilroy's concepts
[
]
Overview
[
]
It is requested that this article section
be expanded
.
Please improve it in any way that you see fit, and remove this notice once the article section is more complete.
As far back as his pitch to Lucasfilm, Gilroy, as a student of history, wanted to imbue the series with themes of revolution, fascism, politics, rebellion, and the regular people caught up on those conflicts.
[
22
]
When Gilroy was asked about political resonances in
Andor
in November 2022, he stated that the series was written without contemporary politics in mind, drawing on historical revolutions simply as spontaneous events to drive the characters' adventures—"whatever contemporary resonance it has is usually in the eye of the beholder. Oppression is oppression."
[
23
]
In another November interview, Gilroy emphasized that his personal politics are "absolutely not important" to the series' themes and that
Star Wars
allows plentiful comparisons to history. As to the "age old question" of "who's a terrorist and who's a freedom fighter," Gilroy wanted every character to "speak for themselves" to make their motives believable and referred the idea of controversial revolutionaries to historical nation-building movements, naming the United States'
Thomas Jefferson
and South Africa
Nelson Mandela
and further listing the revolutions of France,
Haiti
,
Russia and the Soviet Union
, and the nation-building of Israel,
[
24
]
as well as the Palestinian liberation movement.
[
25
]
The
season one finale
took inspiration from the 1966
Gillo Pontecorvo
film
The Battle of Algiers
, which was based on the
Algerian War of Independence
against the colonial
French government
.
[
26
]
Gilroy also likened
Andor
'
s character of
Luthen Rael
as a
start-up company
founder
[
24
]
and, earlier in September, identified the senator and eventual Rebel Alliance leader
Mon Mothma
as a "figurehead of
liberal democracy
that will fail"
[
27
]
—he compared her to
US House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi
in another interview in the same month.
[
28
]
Fiona Shaw
, who played
Maarva Andor
and spoke in an interview released in August 2022, thought that Gilroy's story is a "scurrilous" and "
social-realist
" take on "the
Trumpian
world" that was "exploding in different places right now" with people's rights being taken away.
[
13
]
Five season plan
[
]
"
We were halfway through shooting season 1, coming through Covid, and the monumental size of the show, the effort, and everything else was just dawning on us. We realized that I didn't have enough calories to do it, and Diego's face couldn't take the timing, because it just takes too long to make it. We were saved by Disney saying, 'Okay, if you guys can figure out a way to do it, we're into it.
"
―Tony Gilroy, on shifting to two seasons
[
29
]
Originally, Gilroy thought of
Andor
as a five season show
[
21
]
with around sixty episodes. It was during that planning phase that
Stellan Skarsgård
, who plays Rael, joined the series, but he asked Gilroy to kill off his character at the end of season two so he did not have to stay for the entire series.
[
30
]
According to Gilroy, the five season
Andor
had the same overall story progression as the final series.
[
21
]
In the end, he would decide to pivot to just two seasons and believes that he did not lose anything major.
[
31
]
Gilroy reflected that he had only planned out season one by the time he was heading into a writer's room.
[
21
]
As recalled by Gilroy, the decision to shift to only two seasons came halfway through season one production as the scale of the production became clear to himself and the crew.
[
29
]
Luna feared that he would visibly age over the production of five seasons.
[
32
]
Furthermore, Gilroy believed that there was not enough story left in
Andor
for twelve episodes across four more seasons.
[
33
]
As a solution,
Andor
was shortened to two seasons, with the second season featuring four story arcs that each covered a year of the timeline up to
Rogue One
.
[
32
]
In doing so,
Andor
fulfilled its purpose of telling a five year story. According to Gilroy, Luna and himself came to the decision together while drinking scotch.
[
33
]
Luna, meanwhile, credits Gilroy for the "great idea."
[
32
]
Gilroy considers season two "a fascinating experiment."
[

[

Season one filming
[
]
The original series logo revealed in 2020
On
December 3
, 2020,
[
34
]
Diego Luna confirmed that the series had started filming in London.
[
35
]
The title of
Andor
, as well as behind the scenes footage of the filming of the series, were unveiled on
December 10
, 2020 at a
Disney
investors meeting. Filming began in late
November
of 2020.
[
36
]
[
37
]
Although Alan Tudyk was initially announced to play K-2SO in the series,
[
38
]
he later clarified in
January
of
2021
that while production was underway, he was not going to appear in the first season. He did, however, expect to be brought into the fold in later seasons.
[
39
]
The showrunners opted for practical environments, with scenes being shot at
Pinewood Studios
and on location. One scene was shot at
Pitlochry
,
Scotland
,
[
40
]
while exterior scenes for the
Aldhani dam
were also filmed in Scotland, at the
Cruachan pumped storage hydro plant
.
[
41
]
Ferrix
was very expensive to create. Gilroy stated its "mental build" took two years.
[
42
]
Filming wrapped in
September
2021.
[
43
]
Season two production
[
]
Writers and Actors strikes
[
]
As part of the
2023 Writers Guild of America strike
, Gilroy ceased all services on
Andor
and did not return to the set.
[
44
]
A few weeks before season two's UK shoot was to finish,
Deadline Hollywood
opened an article by stating that filming on season two would pause as a result of the
2023 SAG-AFTRA actors strike
. Later in the piece, however, the article stated that, as per what
Deadline
had learned, the series was still being filmed at Pinewood Studios, but without actors who were part of SAG-AFTRA: American SAG-AFTRA actors had stopped work, as per the strike, while members of the
British Equity union
remained. According to the report, actors who were part of Equity were warned of potential legal action should they stop work in solidarity with the American union.

Post-strikes

"
That's been our attitude all the way through: not to be cynical, and to take it more seriously than anybody ever took it. Even while we’re changing—some people feel as though it's changing a lot—but even while we're changing the grammar of what you can do, we’re trying very rigorously to be more serious about this shit than anybody ever has been.
"
―Tony Gilroy, on making
Andor
[

In
December
2023,
Kathryn Hunter
confirmed she would be returning as
Eedy Karn
for season two and shared some behind the scenes pictures via her Instagram page.
[
47
]
She later took down the post.
[
48
]
Andor
was not present on
Disney+
's 2024 release schedule shown to the public in December 2023.
[
49
]
In an interview with IO9,
Andor
star
Stellan Skarsgård
lit up with a smile upon a mention of
Andor
and promised he was satisfied with the ending, praising Gilroy's writing in specific.
[
50
]
In a
February
2024
interview with GamesRadar+, Skarsgård stated season two would come in late 2024 or early
2025
.
