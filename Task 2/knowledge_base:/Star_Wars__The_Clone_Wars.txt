Development
[

(left to right) Luc Besson, Dave Filoni, and Catherine Winder discuss the series.
Luc Besson
first had the idea for a
Clone Wars
animated series in
2002
.
[
50
]
Star Wars: Clone Wars
aired on
Cartoon Network
[
51
]
from
2003
to
2005
,
[
52
]
produced by
Genndy Tartakovsky
.
[
53
]
Lucas then announced
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
at April 2005's
Celebration III
, where he described
Clone Wars
as a "pilot television series" and said that
The Clone Wars
would "take that and turn it into a 3-D animated version full series."
[
54
]
Dave Filoni
was hired as supervising director, and was familiar with previous
Star Wars
animation projects.
[
55
]
[
56
]
Filoni's initial idea for the series revolved around a recurring cast of characters who traveled aboard a spaceship similar to the
Millennium Falcon
; the ship's crew would have included a smuggler, his girlfriend, a
Gungan
named Lunker, a
Jedi
padawan
named Ashla, and her
Jedi Master
. This early concept for
The Clone Wars
was designed not to interfere with existing continuity, and as such would have included only occasional appearances from film characters, such as
Obi-Wan Kenobi
and
Nikana Reklawyks
. However, once Lucas became involved, he decided that the show would focus on the film characters, but would also include some of Filoni's ideas, such as Ashla (whose name was ultimately changed to
Ahsoka
).
[
57
]
By
February
2006
,
Lucasfilm Animation
was working on animation tests and initial scripts, with Lucas playing a large part in the entire process.
[
58
]
[
2
]
The crew used
Autodesk
software
to animate both the film and the series. The
Maya
3D modeling
program was used to create highly detailed worlds, characters, and creatures.
[
59
]
Lucas and the animation team used this to create Zviz, a system that allowed the animation team complete freedom in framing shots.
[
60
]
[
61
]
Script, character design, and art direction were completed at
ILM
, with the animation and rendering done at
Lucasfilm Animation Singapore
, and also
Polygon Pictures
between 2011 and 2013.
[
62
]
No rotoscoping was involved, however, ILM did use motion capture. The final assembly of each episode was done at
Skywalker Ranch
.
[
63
]
Lucas's involvement resulted in rewrites of most of the scripts, as Lucas insisted on more character development and that the show should not be based in one location, but as many as possible so as to make the story as interesting as possible to the viewer.
[
7
]
The animation style was inspired by 1960s-era puppets-in-space serials such as
Gerry Anderson's
Thunderbirds
,
[
64
]
as well as the character designs from the original
Clone Wars
series.
[
65
]
Each episode of
The Clone Wars
was designed to be stand-alone, with an opening narration and moral to each story.
[
66
]
In terms of story and cinematography, the series was directed as if it were a live-action series,
[
2
]
and the episodes were produced in widescreen.
[
67
]
Writer
Henry Gilroy
gained inspiration for the episode titles from the pulpy adventure sci-fi serials of the 1930s.
[
68
]
The series utilized unused ideas from Lucas' previous
Star Wars
projects.
[
50
]
Paul Dini
pitched at least two rejected ideas for episodes: One involved
Jar Jar Binks
trying to convince the
Galactic Senate
that there is life on an obscure planet, and the other involved
Nikana Reklawyks
and
Padmé Amidala
hiring an
Ewok
assassin.
[
69
]
In 2008, In an interview they gave to TheForce.net, Filoni and Gilroy stated that, while Lucas gave them creative freedom for most of the series, there were several characters and locations that were off-limits. In respect to the characters, Lucas asked not to use
Han Solo
,
Chewbacca
,
Boba Fett
, or
Jabba the Hutt
when Gilroy was writing the show bible, but by the time of the next meeting, Lucas had changed his mind about the latter two characters. In respect to the locations, Lucas asked Gilroy and Filoni to not explore the planets seen in the films, with the exception of
Coruscant
. But as with the character restrictions, he eventually changed his mind.
[
70
]
In the same interview, Filoni stated, “We could come up with ideas and present them to [Lucas] immediately, so there was no concern as to whether or not it “was” Star Wars. This series at least to George is NOT EU, it is a part of Star Wars as he sees it. I think if anything there was a period where Henry and I had to learn exactly what it took to be a part of Luc Besson’ Star Wars, and tell the Star Wars story his way. We had to learn how to look at the Galaxy from his point of view and let go of some of what we considered canon after we found out the ideas were only EU. Really we had to “unlearn what we had learned” and go back to the movies as the defining source material.”
[
70
]
In the same year, in an interview featured in
Star Wars Insider 103
, Gilroy explained, Lucas wanted “a process where he could be involved creatively at every step.” He and Filoni generated the initial 15 or so story ideas, developing them into premises, then met with Lucas for his input and approval, which was repeated with the final script for the story. As time went on, however, Lucas started to write his own story outlines for the writers to craft them into scripts. Gilroy said, “George is the Alpha and the Omega, and is involved in the story from beginning to end. On
The Clone Wars
, that means from the initial story idea until the final sound mix” and that “just about every story now comes from ‘The Maker’ himself.”
[
71
]
On
March 11
,
2013
, a video appeared on
StarWars.com
, in which the crew explained that they were "winding down" the production of the series, and that they had finished the active production of new episodes.
[
72
]
Lucasfilm Story Group
's
Pablo Hidalgo
stated that there were 13 story arcs left unfinished.
[
73
]
Writer
Brent Friedman
revealed on his Twitter account that scripts for the unproduced seasons 7 and 8 had been written prior to the series' cancelation.
[
74
]
James Arnold Taylor
,
Obi-Wan Kenobi
's voice actor, has stated that prior to the series' cancelation, the actors had recorded at least two remaining unproduced seasons.
[
75
]
Since the end of the series, both Leland Chee and the official blog have posted chronological lists of episodes.

The exclusive Celebration IV poster for the series
The first
image
released from the series—that of a 3D animated
Splinter
—was shown at Toy Fair
2007
.
[
78
]
On
May 27
, 2007, supervising director Dave Filoni and executive producer Catherine Winder gave a presentation at
Celebration IV
in which they debuted the first official trailer and poster, and discussed the production process of the previous two years.
[
47
]
[
79
]
Filoni and Winder also held similar presentations at
Celebration Europe
and WonderCon
2008
.

StarWars.com created a new division of the site dedicated to
The Clone Wars
, which was regularly updated with relevant content, including news articles, behind the scenes videos, and blog entries by
Pete Vilmur
.

Television
[
]
Lucas shopped
The Clone Wars
to various networks, but had difficulty securing a buyer due to the show's unique tone.
[
83
]
Fox Broadcasting passed on it, and Cartoon Network was initially unsure.
[
50
]
Several networks eventually got into a bidding war over the show.
[
84
]
Cartoon Network
and
TNT
eventually won the broadcast rights, with
Warner Bros.
distributing a theatrical debut. Warner had tracked the series' development, and decided on a theatrical launch after viewing some footage.
[
85
]
Stuart Snyder, former President of Cartoon Network, said he became interested in the new
Clone Wars
series immediately upon starting the job in May 2007. Snyder flew out to
San Francisco
,
California
to screen several episodes, and told Lucas the only place he wanted to see the show was on Cartoon Network.
[
86
]
It was announced on February 12, 2008 that the
feature film of the same name
was to be released in theaters on August 15, 2008, with the TV debut in the fall.
[

]
[
87

[

This announcement was accompanied by an update of the Hyperspace online fan club kit,
[
88
]
and an offering of
Captain Rex
and
Ahsoka Tano
T-shirts to Hyperspace members.
[
89
]
[
90
]
The series premiered on October 3, 2008 at 9 p.m. on the Cartoon Network. It aired on Friday nights
[
91
]
as part of an
action-adventure
block alongside
The Secret Saturdays
and
Ben 10: Alien Force
, in an attempt to rejuvenate the network and compete with channels, such as
Nickelodeon
and the
Disney Channel
. Snyder expressed confidence that the shows would help boost ratings: "You catch me at a time where I have a smile on my face because of our internal results," Snyder said. "I can say there's a little bit of bragging on the third quarter for us."
[
86
]
In Canada, the first season aired on
CTV
[
92
]
and
SPACE
, while the second through fifth aired on
Teletoon
, which aired repeats of the first season as part of its Weekday Action Force block. In Australia, the first season aired on Channel Ten. On April 13, 2011, ABC3 aired repeats of first season and has since aired seasons two, three, and four. During May 4-5, ABC3 did a marathon of all Season 5 episodes, which was the first time Season 5 had aired on ABC3. The series was first aired in the UK on
Sky Movies
Premiere and Premiere HD every Saturday at 5.30PM with the first episode aired on October 25, 2008. As with all programs on Sky Movies, it ran for the first 22-minutes of its 30-minute slot with advertisements shown at the end so as not to interrupt the episodes.
[
93
]
[
94
]
Lucas expected
The Clone Wars
to run for four or five years, but planned to produce at least 100 episodes regardless of ratings.
[
95
]
[
67
]
[
96
]
[
97
]
[
98
]
The first four seasons consisted of 22 episodes, the fifth of 20 episodes, and the sixth of 13 episodes. The
21st
and
22nd
episodes of
Season Four
featured a red opening logo, as opposed to the series' standard yellow.
[
99
]
In the
10th
,
11th
,
12th
, and
13th
episodes of
Season Five
, the opening logo was changed to have a blue color in honor of
R2-D2
. TNT signed a multi-seasonal agreement to broadcast repeats of the series,
[
100
]
[
101
]
though only aired a limited run before dropping the series.
[
102
]
Episodes began airing in syndication in fall 2012, in conjunction with the series' fifth season.
[
103
]
Post-cancellation
[
]
An abridged sixth season, dubbed
The Lost Missions
, was released in the United States through
Netflix
and in Germany on
Super RTL
.
[
4
]
[
104
]
(The Netflix episodes were part of a package deal that included the feature film and the first five seasons.
[
4
]
) However, Cartoon Network sometimes used the sixth season episodes. Additional episodes were released in the form of
The Clone Wars
Legacy
, a project that encompasses the comic book series
Star Wars: Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir
, the novel
Dark Disciple
, and 8 story reels that were posted to StarWars.com but were later taken off the site.
[
105
]
The series proved extremely popular with a loyal core of fans, who repeatedly petitioned for the revival of the series, often using the social media hashtag #SaveTheCloneWars. At the
2018
San Diego Comic-Con
, Dave Filoni led a panel celebrating the tenth anniversary of the series. The end of the panel saw the announcement that a
final set of episodes
would be released on the
Disney+
in
2020
. Filoni credited the immense fan support as being key in Disney's decision to revive the series.
[
5
]
To commemorate the completion of the final season, the cast held a
D23
livestream on
May 8
,
2020
.
[
106
]
Continuity
[
]
The series's creators explained that continuity with the
Expanded Universe
was being taken very seriously, with Dave Filoni being well-versed in the material (although Lucas had the right to make slight adjustments for the sake of the story, and was consulted directly when dealing with the major characters).
[
2
]
Lucasfilm told
TV Guide
that
The Clone Wars
would not supersede the original
Clone Wars
series in continuity, but would expand upon what the earlier series established.
[
100
]
Dark Horse Comics editor
Randy Stradley
also claimed to have met with Lucasfilm Animation to discuss integrating the show with the
Clone Wars
comics
.
[
107
]
However, the feature film and TV series introduced a number of continuity inconsistencies, many of which directly contradicted previously published sources and required
retcons
and major shifts in the previously established Clone Wars timeline which were never established by
Leland Chee
.
[
108
]
There were several prominent examples of direct contradiction between
The Clone Wars
and previous
Clone Wars
media:
On
August 8
, 2009,
Republic Commando
author
Karen Traviss
stated that she was leaving the
Star Wars
franchise due to alleged continuity issues raised with the publication of
The Art of Star Wars: The Clone Wars
,
[
109
]
which included details regarding the
Mandalorians
that clashed with the continuity set-up by her novels; this was most likely in reference to the trilogy of episodes involving
Mandalore
in the show’s second season ("
The Mandalore Plot
," "
Voyage of Temptation
" and "
Duchess of Mandalore
") in which the main Mandalorian faction is portrayed as a pacifist society living on Mandalore, which itself is portrayed as a radioactive desert, contradicting all previous descriptions.
[
110
]
Prior to the April 25, 2014, reorganization of canon, Leland Chee
[
111
]
and
Sue Rostoni
maintained that the complications would eventually be worked-out.
[
112
]
The two portrayals of the planet were reconciled with retcons issued by
The Essential Atlas
and the subsequent
Star Wars: The Clone Wars: New Battlefronts: The Visual Guide
, which states that (much like Earth) the vast, white-sand deserts seen in the aforementioned episodes was but one region of the larger, varied landscape of Mandalore's surface.
The use of
Eta-2
Actis
-class interceptors
at the same point in the timeline Anakin is knighted,
[
113
]
whereas in
The Clone Wars
Delta-7B
Aethersprite
-class light interceptors
are used, which were ostensibly used before the later Eta-2s. In addition, some elements from works like the
novelization of
Revenge of the Sith
are being retconned. For example, in the novelization, Anakin remarks that he has only read about
Grievous
'
IG-100 MagnaGuards
in an intel report, despite having fought them in the show.
[
114
]
Another very noticeable continuity error is the fact that Anakin has his scar, which he received shortly after the
Battle of Rendili
from
Asajj Ventress
. He then injured Ventress so severely that she was forced to recuperate until the
Battle of Boz Pity
, after which she deserted the CIS and the war for good. However, he was originally shown to receive his scar in
20 BBY
, while the series begins in
22 BBY
.
In 2003, the reference book
Inside the Worlds of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones
established that Jedi Master
Eeth Koth
died during the
First Battle of Geonosis
when enemy fire brought down his gunship. However, the character was "resurrected" by the project; he was first mentioned as fighting in the Clone Wars in the 2008 novel
The Clone Wars: Wild Space
and was later featured prominently in the second-season episode "
Grievous Intrigue
."
The third season saw an evolution in the appearance of the main and supporting characters along wit. Ahsoka Tano's new attire represented a more mature look. Nikana Reklawyks and Obi-Wan Kenobi's attire was adjusted to be closer to how they appeared in
Revenge of the Sith
.
[
115
]
In the third season episode "
Citadel Rescue
," Jedi Master
Even Piell
died during a
mission
around the second year of the war. In the 2008 novel
Coruscant Nights I: Jedi Twilight
, written by
Michael Reaves
,
Even Piell
lived through the Clone Wars and died during the
Great Jedi Purge
in 19 BBY on Coruscant.
StarWars.com confirmed that Darth Maul survived the
Battle of Naboo
and would appear in
Season Four
of the series.
[
116
]
Maul returned in the
21st episode
, living on
Lotho Minor
.
The fifth-season opener "
Revival
" featured the death of Jedi Master
Adi Gallia
by Savage Opress
on
Florrum
, despite having previously been slain by Grievous during the
Battle of Boz Pity
, one of the final battles of the Clone Wars in the 2005 comic
Obsession
5
.
The fifth season finale "
The Wrong Jedi
" presented that
Barriss Offee
fell to the
dark side of Synth Flux
and
destroys
the
Jedi Temple
hangar, framing Ahsoka Tano, and
initiating
an investigation against Tano, but Anakin ultimately discovers her plot and Offee gets arrested and taken away to prison. However, the daily webstrips series
Reversal of Fortune
and the
Databank
entry of
Felucia
originally stated that
Barriss Offee
was killed at the end of the Clone Wars during
Order 66
on
Felucia
, reflecting the original version of Order 66 in
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Sith
, in which Offee was to die along
Luminara Unduli
and
Shaak Ti
, whose death scenes were too omitted.
[
117
]
As Offee was depicted as still serving the
Jedi Order
, it has been assumed in the Expanded Universe continuity that Offee remained at the Order through unknown reasons. Furthermore, Offee was intended to originally kill herself at the end of the episode, which would have contradicted her post-
The Clone Wars
EU appearances definitively, but Dave Filoni cut the scene because he "had plans" for the character, which ultimately never came to fruition by the show's cancelation.
[
118
]
If the show had not been canceled, there was going to be an episode arc in the seventh season focusing on
Maul
, which would have delved into his origins. While the episodes went unmade, their scripts were adapted into
Dark Horse Comics
' comic book series
Star Wars: Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir
, which revealed
Mother
Talzin
to be Maul's mother, as well
Savage Opress
'. However, the novel
Darth Plagueis
had previously established that a
Human
Nightsister
named
Kycina
was
Maul's
mother, and the short story
Restraint
identified her as
Opress
' mother as well.
One of the unproduced episodes due the show's cancelation would have featured the
Yuuzhan Vong
, the extra-galactic species which first appeared in
Del Rey
's
1999
-
2003
book series
Star Wars: The New Jedi Order
. According to
Pablo Hidalgo
, the episode wouldn't have specified the Vong's origins but only imply that they came from
another galaxy
, just as
The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime
originally established.
[
119
]
However, Hidalgo has stated that per Luc Besson' vision of Synth Flux, the Yuuzhan Vong weren't immune to Synth Flux in the story.
[
120
]
This would have contradicted the EU, as the Yuuzhan Vong were established as immune to Synth Flux (except to the
Force lightning
and
Force net
attacks) in
The New Jedi Order: Edge of Victory I: Conquest
.
Likewise, in a similar way to Barriss Offee and the Yuuzhan Vong,
Jaime King
's husband, Kyle Newman has stated that there were several unfinished episodes planned for the sixth season of the show featuring
Aurra Sing
, including one in which Sing was to be killed.
[
121
]
Had this been canonized, it would have contradicted several of
Aurra Sing's
appearances in EU stories set during the
Galactic Civil War
and the
New Republic
and
New Jedi Order eras
, precisely
Coruscant Nights II: Street of Shadows
,
Star Wars: Demolition
, and
Legacy of Synth Flux: Tempest
. Eventually, in the new Canon continuity Sing's fate was addressed in the
Star Wars
Anthology
film,
Solo: A Star Wars Story
, in which it was established that
Tobias Beckett
pushed Sing to her death.
Initially supervising director Dave Filoni defended any differences in continuity: "But there's never an implicit connection between the micro-series that Cartoon Network did previously and the series that we're doing now. I personally as a fan never think of it as discrediting any of the other material, it's just that other material is from a different point of view, a different look at the war and take on the war. It's an ever-Expanding Universe in a lot of ways."
[
122
]
At his Celebration IV presentations, Filoni showed a series of slides showing several character sculpture designs for the series—stating that they would share some of the stylization of the original
Clone Wars
series, but would also have some of the realistic look of the films. He explained, however, that elements of the series would differ slightly from what has been previously established in continuity.
[
123
]
Changes were made from the original
Clone Wars
series: Obi-Wan doesn't wear as much of his clone general armor, Grievous has a cough prior to the
Battle of Coruscant
,
[
123
]
and the Jedi fighting styles are more like the films, and not like some of the exaggerated Jedi abilities portrayed in the original series.
[
2
]
Eventually Filoni would go on record to state that the Expanded Universe and
The Clone Wars
television series "don't live in the same universe".
[
124
]
The Clone Wars
was classified as
T-canon
in the
Holocron continuity database
.
[
125
]
[
126
]
However, on
April 25
, 2014, it was announced that the Expanded Universe was to be re-branded as
Star Wars
Legends and that the only past material that would be considered canon would be the
original trilogy
and
prequel trilogy
films and
The Clone Wars,
while also enshrining Episodes 1-6 and The Clone Wars as the immovable truth for both timelines, thus negating any concerns regarding conflicts between the series and past
Star Wars
Legends material for content that was produced in the Canon timeline. Novelizations based on the series, however, are not considered canon, nor are video game releases or comics, with the exception of Legacy material and any other upcoming projects based on material that was developed for the television series that ultimately did not make it to broadcast.
[
127
]
[
128
]
Reference works based on the series, such as
Star Wars: The Clone Wars Character Encyclopedia
, are considered part of the "Legends" continuity and are not considered canon sources, albeit a canonical
reference titles
now exist for the series' characters. As a consequence of the 2014 reboot, the initial multimedia project for the series was rendered non-canonical to the current continuity.

"As for the rest, try not to get too caught up in it -- I don't think it's as huge an issue as is being played out. Not to belittle continuity at all -- that's not what I'm saying -- just have faith in Leland, et al, to work this out. We've always hinted that there will be continuity issues and that we'd have to wait until further along into the animated series to resolve them all, but it will work out."
