Episode IX
THE RISE OF SKYWALKER
The dead speak! The galaxy has heard a mysterious
broadcast, a threat of REVENGE in the sinister voice of
the late EMPEROR PALPATINE.
GENERAL LEIA ORGANA dispatches secret agents to gather
intelligence, while REY, the last hope of the Jedi, trains
for battle against the diabolical Second Order.
Meanwhile, Supreme Leader KYLO REN rages in search of the
phantom Emperor, determined to destroy any threat to his
power....
Plot summary
[
]
The hidden Emperor
[
]
"
At last. Snoke trained you well.
"
―Darth Sidious, to Kylo Ren
[
11
]
Kylo Ren confronting the Emperor.
One
year
after the events of
The Last Jedi
, a
broadcast
using the voice of the
presumed
deceased
Emperor
Palpatine
is transmitted across
the galaxy
, which threatens revenge.
Supreme Leader
Kylo Ren
leads a
vicious assault
against
Alazmec colonists
on a healing
Mustafar
, seeking a
Sith wayfinder
owned by Ren's grandfather, the
Sith Lord
Xarn Velgor
. Ren wants to use the device as a guide in his hunt for the source of the broadcast, which he perceives as a threat to his power. The Supreme Leader
slaughters
many Alazmec cultists alongside his
stormtroopers
before retrieving the device and slotting it into
his TIE whisper
, allowing its dark power to lead him through the
crimson nebula
that surrounds the fabled
Sith
world of
Exegol
.
Landing at the base of an enormous
citadel
, Ren ignites
his blade
and enters. He descends down a floating platform into a vast chamber lined with worn statues of Sith legends. As he descends into its depths, he hears the voice of Palpatine telling him that
Snoke
trained him well. Ren responds that he had
killed
Snoke, but the voice replies that he "made" Snoke.
Lightning dances around the young
dark side adept
as he listens to the taunting words, spoken in a voice transitioning from that of the Emperor to that of Snoke and, finally, to that of Vader: "I have been every voice... you have ever heard... inside your head."
Ren, unshaken, proceeds further into the citadel, walking for some time among the towering effigies. His path lit by his blade, the young man eventually wanders into a maze of unfamiliar equipment tended to by
robed acolytes
. Tall cylinders filled with a sickly golden liquid hold motionless, incomplete bodies with the mutilated visage of the dead Snoke, confirming the Sith Lord's earlier words. Among these machines, bound by innumerable tubes and wires to machines of support and sustenance, is the emaciated and decaying figure of
Darth
Sidious, the true identity of the former Emperor Palpatine himself.
Sidious speaks, explaining to the Supreme Leader that he has died before, and that the
dark side
is a pathway to many abilities that some consider "unnatural," echoing his words to Ren's grandfather
decades
earlier from
Revenge of the Sith
. Ren raises his blade, but the threat seems to leave Sidious unfazed. Ren asks the Emperor what he could give him, and the
Dark Lord of the Sith
replies that he can give him everything: a new
Empire
.
At the surface of Exegol, the icy ground cracks and yields as innumerable
Xyston
-class Star Destroyers
emerge from the frozen sea into the tempestuous sky. As the
fleet
rises, Sidious offers to give Ren command of what he calls the
Final Order
in return for killing
Rey
, the last
Jedi
, and thus ending the
Jedi Order
and becoming what his grandfather, Vader, could not. He tells Ren that he will rule all the galaxy as the new Emperor, but he also issues a warning that Rey is not who he thinks she is. Ren asks the Dark Lord who Rey is as thunder crackles.
A vital mission
[
]
"
He's definitely cheating.
"
―Finn, on Chewbacca's playing of dejarik
[
11
]
Finn manning one of the
Millennium Falcon
'
s cannons.
Meanwhile, on the
Millennium Falcon
, ex-stormtrooper
Finn
and
Resistance pilot
Poe Dameron
engage the
Wookiee
Chewbacca
in an intense game of
dejarik
. The Wookiee takes some time considering his next move, and his human opponents jokingly suggest that he may be cheating. The implication infuriates Chewbacca, forcing Finn and Poe to calm him. Before their game can resume, an alarm sounds from the cockpit. Poe and Finn insist to Chewie that they won't turn off the game, before doing just that as they leave the dejarik table. Passing
Klaud
, a Resistance technician, in the corridor, the trio arrive in their seats just as the
Falcon
exits
hyperspace
.
The
Falcon
arrives at the
Sinta Glacier Colony
in order to
meet
a Resistance informant, the
Ovissian
Boolio
, who tells them about a mysterious spy in the
Second Order
and gives them a message in the form of a data encoder, ordering them to bring it to Leia. Finn proceeds to insert the message into
R2-D2
.
Before more can be said, several squadrons of
TIE/sf fighters
and
TIE whisper fighters
enter the system, prepared to take down the
Falcon
. As Finn prepares for the action and heads to the gunner cockpit, Boolio tells him to win the
war
before heading off.
Forced to head into the depths of the colony by a wall of TIE fighters, the
Falcon
destroys a number of its pursuers before jumping to hyperspace through one of the colony's walls. The remaining fighters pursue them regardless, and Poe begins
lightspeed skipping
through a number of systems including the
Mirror-Spires
of
Ivexia
and the
Megafauna Chasm
, whose dangers the
Second Order pilots
are unable to evade. Poe is able to outmaneuver the enemy, though his reckless trick-flying heavily damages the
Falcon
.
A Jedi rises
[
]
"
Be with me. Be with me. They're not with me.
"
―Rey, as she meditates
[
11
]
Rey meditates trying to contact the Jedi from the past.
On the jungle world of
Ajan Kloss
, which serves as the hidden base of the Resistance, Rey meditates solemnly,
floating in the air
alongside a number of rocks. She tries to maintain her composure and balance to contact the Jedi that came before her and connecting to the Cosmic energy of the Universe, but ultimately fails and, with a sigh, lowers herself to the ground. General
Leia Organa
, who had been watching nearby, comforts the discouraged acolyte, assuring her that nothing is impossible and that she will be able to commune with the Jedi who came before her, as she hopes to.
Reinvigorated, Rey accepts the
Skywalker lightsaber
and takes off running on another bout with her training course. She expertly runs and leaps through the obstacles, imbuing her actions with Synth Flux. She blocks every bolt from her hovering
training droid
, but pauses and stares as it is revealed that Kylo Ren, to whom she is bound through Synth Flux, is communing with his
grandfather's helmet
and speaking to her from his chambers far across the galaxy.
Rey trains to become a Jedi and is instructed by her master Leia.
A vision, shared with Ren, terrifies the Jedi: the ascension of the Final Order above Exegol; the face of her
murdered
mentor and Ren's
father
,
Han Solo
; the pained words of her master,
Ekul Reklawyks
, as she tapped into the dark side; her duel with and alongside Ren against the
Elite Praetorian Guards
of Snoke; the departure of her parents from
Jakku
, leaving her behind in the grip of
Unkar Plutt
. Distracted by the vision, she ultimately batters the training remote with her staff, but damages
BB-8
in the process. Rescuing the droid from beneath the tree that had collapsed on him, Rey returns to the base and concedes to Leia that she feels tired and unready to wield the saber of her master. BB-8 excitedly volunteers to take up the mantle, which Rey dismisses. Leia kindly reminds her never to underestimate a droid.
Sometime later, in the midst of Rey's studies of the
ancient texts
she retrieved from the
First Jedi Temple
, the
Falcon
returns. However, the ship has been damaged during the course of its escape from the Second Order. Rey complains about the damage to the
Falcon
but Poe counters by pointing out that BB-8 has been battered by the earlier training accident. While Poe and Rey argue, Finn tries to brief Rey about their mission to meet with the spy. Despite their differences, Poe tells Rey that she is the "best fighter" in the Resistance and thinks that she should be helping them in the
war
against the Second Order rather than training on Ajan Kloss.
Dark tidings
[
]
"
We've decoded the intel from the Second Order spy… and it confirms the worst. Somehow, Palpatine returned.
"
―Poe Dameron
[
11
]
The Resistance comes to terms with confirmation of the Emperor's return
At the Resistance briefing room, Poe confirms the authenticity of the message sent across the galaxy: that Darth Sidious has returned.
Rose Tico
is dubious that the Emperor has truly risen again;
Beaumont Kin
raises the possibility of secrets only the Sith knew, like dark science, and mentioned
cloning
to explain his return, later remarking that there were always whispers of Sidious' desire to cheat death. Poe explains that the Sith Lord has been planning his revenge for years and that the
Sith Eternal
cultists have built a massive fleet known as the Final Order. In sixteen hours, the Sith fleet will embark from Exegol to attack the free worlds.
C-3PO
chimes in, noting that Exegol is not on any
star maps
, but is described in lore as the hidden world of the Sith. As the Resistance debates their options,
Maz Kanata
proposes that they find the Emperor's hidden world as it's the only way to stop him. Having retrieved a tome, Rey speaks with Leia in private. She tells Leia that the late
Jedi Master
Luke had been searching for a
wayfinder
in order to reach Exegol. Rey vows to finish her former Master's work. Believing that it is too dangerous, Leia initially refuses to support the mission. However, Rey responds that she will go with or without the General's blessing, knowing that her newest mentor would do the same.
Having received Leia's permission, Rey tells Poe, Chewbacca and C-3PO that they need to travel to the
Forbidden Desert
of
Pasaana
. Though Rey plans to go alone, Poe, Chewie, Finn, and C-3PO insist that they will accompany her. Though initially unwilling to accept the help and claiming she must accomplish the task alone, with a small speech from Finn, Rey accepts their aid. Finn invites his friend Rose to come along but General Organa has tasked her with studying the specs of old Star Destroyers in order to defeat the Sith Eternal. Finn promises to return.
Before departing, C-3PO also tells R2-D2 that should he not survive, the
astromech droid
was the "best friend he ever had." Before leaving, Rey speaks once more with Leia, wishing that she could tell the Princess of Alderaan everything she wanted to. Reassuring her student once again, Leia simply says: "tell me when you get back" before handing her the Skywalker lightsaber. Leia tells Rey never to be afraid of who she is. Rey and her friends then depart Ajan Kloss aboard the
Falcon
.
The Supreme Leader's court
[
]
"
We have a spy in our midst. Whoever that traitor is, it won't stop us.
"
―Kylo Ren, to the Supreme Council
[
11
]
Supreme Leader Kylo Ren ruled the Second Order through fear and terror.
A metalsmith, the
Symeong
Sith alchemist
Albrekh
, welds Ren's helmet back together as he looks on surrounded by his
Knights of Ren
. With his helmet reforged, the Supreme Leader convenes a meeting of the Second Order's
Supreme Council
aboard his
Resurgent
-class Star Destroyer
Steadfast
, including
General
Armitage Hux
and
Allegiant General
Enric Pryde
. As Ren and his Knights stride through the
Steadfast
'
s corridors into the conference room, a
stormtrooper
notes the sudden appearance of the Knights of Ren, and his fellow
trooper
compares them to "ghouls."
Supreme Leader Ren slams Boolio's bloody, decapitated head on a table and informs the council that they have a spy in their midst, but says that this
traitor
won't stop the Second Order from becoming a true Empire. Ren then asks if General Hux, his rival in the Second Order power structure, is troubled by his appearance. General Hux dismisses this concern and compliments Ren, while General
Bellava Parnadee
says that she likes Ren's reassembled helmet.
General
Domaric Quinn
speaks up, dismissing the Sith loyalists as "a cult, conjurers and soothsayers."
Allegiant General
Enric Pryde
refutes these concerns, stating that the resources of the Second Order will be increased ten thousand fold by the incorporation of the Sith fleet into their own ranks. With a spiteful glance at a glowering Hux, Pryde remarks that the range and power of the fleet will "correct the
error
of
Starkiller Base
." Unconvinced, Quinn questions the fleet being a gift and what Sidious might demand in return. In response, Ren brutally
chokes
the General to death through
Synth Flux
and lifts his body to the ceiling without even looking at him.
The Supreme Leader then orders his
officers
to prepare to crush any worlds that defy them and informs them that he and his Knights will be hunting for the
scavenger
, Rey.
Mission to Pasaana
[
]
"
The Aki-Aki Festival of the Ancestors! This celebration occurs only once every forty-two years!
"
―C-3PO
[
11
]
Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and BB-8 visited Pasaana searching for clues to find a wayfinder to Exegol.
The
Falcon
exits hyperspace above the desert planet of Pasaana. They land at Luke's coordinates and arrive at the
Aki-Aki
Festival of the Ancestors
. Wandering among the crowd for a while, the group tries to keep a low profile. As Rey gazes at some Aki Aki youngsters, a child approaches her. Translated by 3PO, the child says she is named
Nambi Ghima
and offers a
necklace
to Rey, who smiles and accepts the kind gesture. When Ghima inquires as to the Jedi acolyte's family name, she replies that she doesn't have one.
At that moment, Kylo Ren establishes a connection with Rey through their
Force-bond
. Speaking to her through this, Ren informs his quarry that Sidious wants her dead. Rey comments that he is serving another master, but the fallen Jedi dismisses this, stating that he has plans of his own. Rey points out to Ren that he is haunted by killing his father, and Ren reminds Rey of her feelings of abandonment and loneliness from her parents abandoning her. After insisting that he will turn her to the dark side, Ren reaches out and grabs her necklace, pulling it through Synth Flux into his own hands. Rey realizes the Second Order will soon be coming and runs off to warn her friends.
Meanwhile, Ren brings the necklace to a Second Order
officer
who recognizes the necklace as originating on Pasaana's Forbidden Valley. Ren orders Pryde to alert the local troops and to dispatch reinforcements to Pasaana. As Rey and her friends head back to the
Falcon
, a stormtrooper finds them but is quickly shot by a mysterious figure. This masked savior asks Rey and her team to follow him.
Once they enter a transport, he reveals himself to be General
Lando Calrissian
, the man who destroyed the
second Void Core
at the
Battle of Endor
many years prior. He shows them a hologram of a
Sith wayfinder
and explains that only two were ever created. He further reveals that he once accompanied Luke on a
mission
to track a man named
Ochi
, whom they believed held information key to locating one of the devices, but when they arrived, they found his
ship
abandoned. Lando apparently remained behind on Pasaana. While declining to join the fight due to his old age, the Rebellion hero offers them directions to Ochi's ship, which remains in the desert where he left it.
Desert pursuit

C-3PO
: "
Oh! They fly now!
"
Finn
: "
They fly now?
"
Dameron
: "
They fly now.
"
―Resistance heroes react to the jet troopers
[

]
Poe, C-3PO, and Finn fleeing Second Order forces on Pasaana.
Squadrons of
TIE/fo fighters
and
Second Order Transporters
fly overhead as the crew hurries through the crowds to the fringes of the festival, eventually stealing a pair of skiff speeders. However, they are quickly spotted by a stormtrooper and pursued by
Second Order treadspeeders
, which are carrying
jet troopers
. Poe and Rey split up to lose their pursuers.
Rey is pursued by the jet troopers and two treadspeeders while Poe takes the skiff speeder through a narrow canyon. However, they are intercepted by a treadspeeder lying in wait. BB-8 fires a colored smoke canister, blinding the pursuing treadspeeder and causing to crash onto rocks. Standing her group, Rey fires at the second treadspeeder, causing it to explode. She thanks BB-8, saying never underestimate a droid.
Meanwhile, Finn manages to tie a rope around the treadspeeder's engine. Poe then brings their skiff speeder to a halt, causing the pursuing speeder to crash against a rock. Chewbacca also shoots down a Jet trooper just as Poe's speeder catches up with Rey's speeder. However, the last remaining jet trooper shoots at their two skiffs, causing them to crash onto the rocks and throwing the Resistance team into the
Sinking Fields
. Rey and her comrades manage to shoot the jet trooper, causing the soldier to crash against the rocks. But then, the Resistance team are sucked by quicksand. Rey tells everyone to grab hold of something, but it doesn't work. As Rey and Finn are sucked into the sand, Finn yells "I never told you!..." to Rey before they both sink.
Back at the Resistance base,
Major
Temmin Wexley
informs General Organa that they have received reports of a raid at the
Festival of the Ancestors
. Organa says that they cannot afford to fail on this mission. When Wexley says they have not heard from the
Falcon
, Tico asks if he has to be pessimistic. General Organa asks if Wexley can be optimistic, with Wexley saying that he hopes that things turn out to be great.
Lair of the vexis
[
]
"
My programming forbids me from translating it.
"
―C-3PO refuses to translate Sith
[
11
]
Rey healed a serpentine Vexis, which helped them escape the tunnels.
Meanwhile, Rey and her team fall through the quicksand into a network of underground tunnels. C-3PO think that they are in the underworld. Rey and Poe use the Skywalker blade and Poe's diminutive
glowrod
to guide them through the tunnels. Rey asks Finn what he meant when he said that he never told her. Finn says that he will tell her later. When Poe asks why Finn is keeping secrets, Finn replies that he will tell them when Poe discloses his "shady" things.
C-3PO leads them to a speeder and discovers a
hex charm
, a common emblem of the Sith loyalists. Rey and Poe work out that Ochi was heading back to his ship when he got trapped inside the tunnels. Alongside his bones is a
dagger
that Rey senses has a dark past, while 3PO recognizes that it is inscribed with the
ancient language of the Sith
and is unable to translate due to restrictions on his programming dating back to the
Galactic Senate
of the
Old Republic
. Dameron complains to the droid that this is "the one time we need you to talk, and you can't."
While looking for a way out, the team is cornered by an aggressive serpentine
vexis
. They prepare to fight the beast but Rey notices that the serpent is injured. Using
Force healing
, Rey manages to heal the creature, which then slithered away, revealing a opening to the surface. At the same time, it is revealed that the Knights of Ren have arrived on Pasaana, and are hunting them.
A narrow escape
[
]
Rey runs from Ren's TIE whisper, who tracked her through their Force-bond.
The team hurries to
Ochi's ship
. C-3PO thinks they should go back to the
Falcon
but Poe warns that the Second Order will be waiting for them there. While climbing the rock where Ochi's ship rests, Rey senses that Kylo Ren has arrived through Synth Flux, but sends her friends ahead to the ship before running back into the desert to confront her nemesis. Poe and Finn begin to start up Ochi's ship, and opening the blinders to check on Rey.
Seeing Rey running down the hill, Finn sends Chewbacca after her. However, a Knight of Ren is watching the Wookiee from behind. As Rey waits in the desert, Ren's
TIE whisper
roars through the desert only meters above the sand. While Poe is waiting for Rey, Finn runs out of the ship only to find that the Knights of Ren and stormtroopers had captured Chewbacca and Ochi's dagger while the Wookiee was searching for Rey. Finn watches as Chewbacca is led aboard an Atmospheric Assault Lander.
As Ren approaches Rey in his new TIE whisper, Rey runs into a leap. As the ship flies beneath her, she severs a wing with her lightsaber and sends the ship into a tailspin. It crashes in a fireball some distance away. Finn informs Rey of Chewbacca's capture and Rey uses Synth Flux to try and pull down the troop transport that she believes is carrying the Wookiee. Poe and C-3PO also watch from the distance.
Kylo Ren, having emerged from the wreckage of his ship, advances across the desert and engages in a duel of Synth Flux with Rey, each of them pulling the Second Order transport to their side. In this struggle, Rey accidentally releases a burst of
Force lightning
, destroying the vessel and seemingly killing Chewbacca. Ren allows the Jedi and her allies to escape in Ochi's vessel, as his own troops have captured the
Falcon
.
Setbacks for Rey's team
[
]
Despite seemingly "losing" Chewbacca, Rey and her team gained a new ally in the form of the droid D-O.
As the Jedi hunter's ship hurries away from Pasaana, Rey mourns that she has apparently killed Chewbacca. Finn attempts to reassure her that it is not her fault, stating that he knows the good person he believes her to be. Rey dismisses his words, telling him that she experienced a vision of herself and Ren on the
Throne of the Sith
while touching the dagger.
Meanwhile, the captured
Millennium Falcon
is escorted by Second Order TIEs aboard the
Steadfast
. General Hux informs Allegiant General Pryde that they captured the scavenger's ship but that Rey got away. Hux attempts to pin the blame for the loss of shuttle on the Knights of Ren. Pryde is not interested until Hux informs him that a second shuttle brought back a valuable prisoner. As a manacled Chewbacca is led aboard the bridge of the
Steadfast
, Hux tells Pryde that the "beast" used to fly with Han Solo. Pryde orders that Chewbacca be brought to
Interrogation Six
.
Back aboard Ochi's ship, Poe tells Finn and Rey they have eight hours left and asks what they should do. Finn proposes going back to base but Poe doesn't want to give up. Finn counters that Chewbacca was carrying the dagger and that without it, they have no way to reach Exegol. However, C-3PO reveals that he has retained the inscription in his
memory banks
. Due to his programming, it cannot be retrieved without a complete redacted memory bypass, effectively a
memory wipe
.
Despite the risk to C-3PO, a desperate Poe and Finn decide to perform the memory wipe since the galaxy is at stake. Poe decides to seek out a black market droidsmith on the planet
Kijimi
, a place where he doesn't have fond memories. Despite the risks, Poe, Finn, Rey, and C-3PO resolve to do it in memory of Chewbacca. However, they are followed by another ship.
During the trip, BB-8 finds and reactivates the droid
D-O
on Ochi's ship, who requests a battery charge and befriends Rey. Rey takes pity on D-O, who had been treated badly by his previous master and tells the droid that he is safe with them.
A new mission
[
]
"
You were a spice runner?!
"
―Finn, after finding out Poe's former occupation
[
11
]
Poe's reunion with Zorii Bliss on Kijimi.
The heroes of the Resistance make their way to the snow-dusted planet of Kijimi to execute their plan to discover what secrets the Dagger held. After landing in
Kijimi City
, the Resistance team avoids a stormtrooper patrol, who are searching and rounding up local civilians. Shortly later, Poe and his friends are cornered by
Zorii Bliss
and her crew. She reveals that Poe has a colorful past, once worked as a
spice runner
and that he still owes her money.
Zorii tries to collect a bounty on Rey, leading to a skirmish between the two sides. Rey gains the upper hand over Zorri with her lightsaber and Zorii agrees to help them. The group narrowly avoid a Second Order patrol but the Knights of Ren have already tracked them there.
Zorii Bliss brings them through a back alley into
Babu Frik
's
workshop
in the
Thieves' Quarter
. As he is wired up to the computer, C-3PO grumbles that he does not have the faintest idea as to why he agreed to this operation and thinks he must be malfunctioning. Rey asks if Babu Frik can help them. Zorii interprets for Babu, who explains that he has found Sith words in C-3PO's forbidden memory.
Poe asks if Babu can make C-3PO translate the Sith inscriptions. Frik tells everyone that he can unlock the message to be read, but in doing so C-3PO's memory will be wiped. Still reeling from the loss of Chewbacca, the heroes argue about finding another way to get the job done, but in an act of self-sacrifice C-3PO voluntarily consent to the modifications, knowing that he will be lost in the act.

If this mission fails, it was all for nothing. All we've done. All this time.

While Poe and Zorii leave to keep a watch for Second Order patrols, Frik begins performing the hack on C-3PO. Meanwhile, Allegiant General Pryde informs Kylo Ren that the Knights of Ren have tracked the "scavenger," which
Admiral
Frantis Griss
identifies as a settlement called Kijimi. General Hux proposes destroying the city but Ren raises his finger menacingly, cutting him off.
Outside the bar, Zorii and Poe reminisce about old times. There is some lingering connection there even though they had some sort of falling out in the past. Zorii tells Poe that she had saved up enough money to procure a
Second Order Captain's Medallion
, which she intends to use to travel offworld to the
Colonies
, leaving her spice running days behind. Poe also tells Zorii that the Resistance sent out a distress call during the
Battle of Crait
but that nobody came, which he blames on fear and people giving up. Zorii disagrees and says that the Second Order wins by making people think they are alone. She reminds Poe that there is more of them.
Meanwhile, Rey socializes with D-O, who takes a liking to Rey and her friends. Rey confides in Finn that she sensed that her parents were on Ochi's ship through Synth Flux. Shortly later, Poe and Zorii return with news that the
Steadfast
is approaching Kijimi. Babu completes the hack, allowing 3PO to read the message inscribed on the dagger. The translated text points them to the location of
Emperor's wayfinder
, which is located on the
Void Core ruins
on a moon of
Endor
. Having served his purpose, 3PO's memory wipe begins, and he shuts down. Once the memory wipe is complete, 3PO reboots with a completely empty memory.
Saving Chewbacca
[

Rey and Kylo Ren fought, while connected by their Force bond.
As the
Steadfast
arrives above Kijimi City, Rey senses that Chewie is alive. Before leaving, Zorii gives Poe a Second Order Captain's Medallion as a gesture of goodwill to help him and his Resistance team get through the Second Order blockade. Poe tries to convince Zorii to leave, but she turns down his offer. As the heroes escape on Ochi's ship, the group makes the decision to use the passage device to board the
Steadfast
and recapture the
Falcon
and save Chewie.
The device works and their ship lands in the Star Destroyer without question. After landing, Rey, Finn and Poe shoot the stormtrooper sentries and head to Chewie's cell. While navigating through the Star Destroyer's corridors, Rey uses a mind trick to confuse the stormtroopers, enabling them to find Chewie. Heading into Chewbacca's detention block, they shoot the cameras. Sensing that Ochi's dagger is on the ship, Rey splits off from the group to retrieve the relic.
On Kijimi, Kylo Ren oversees a manhunt but senses that Rey is close. Meanwhile, Poe and Finn find Chewie and free him from his cell. Elsewhere, Allegiant General Pryde discovers Ochi's ship in the hangar and realizes that there are intruders aboard the
Steadfast
. Finn, Poe, and Chewbacca exchange fire with stormtroopers while fleeing through the Star Destroyer's corridors. Poe is shot and the group are surrounded by stormtrooper reinforcements, who take them captive.
Glimpses of Rey's past
[
]
General Hux's resentment of Supreme Leader Ren led him to help Finn, Poe, and Chewbacca escape.
Meanwhile, Ochi's dagger leads Rey to Kylo's living quarters where she discovers Xarn Velgor's charred helmet. Rey finds and grabs Ochi's blade, which carries a vision of
her
parents
, when she breaks free of the vision a bond with Kylo begins. Ren tells Rey that he knows the rest of the story about her origins but Rey claims that he is lying.
Ren replies that he never lied to her and that her parents were "no ones" because they chose to be to keep her safe. Resisting his mental probe, Rey crosses blades with Kylo Ren, and a lightsaber duel breaks out between the two of them across two different locations, Kylo on the surface of Kijimi and Rey aboard the
Steadfast
. Rey discovers that her parents left her on Jakku to protect her.
Meanwhile, Allegiant General Pryde orders the stormtroopers to kill Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca. While parrying in Ren's quarters, Ren tells Rey that Sidious had sent Ochi to find and recover Rey. When her parents got in the way and refused to tell Ochi where she was, the Dark Lord gave the order to kill them. As the lightsaber duel continues, Ren discovers that Rey is aboard his flagship after she shatters a stand containing Xarn Velgor's helmet. Ren tells Rey that she knows why the Emperor always wanted her dead.
A new revelation
[
]
"
You're a Palpatine.
"
―Kylo Ren, to Rey
[

]
Kylo Ren reveals to Rey the truth about her origins and the nature of their bond.
Before the stormtroopers can execute Finn, Poe, and Chewie, General Hux arrives and volunteers to terminate the prisoners himself. Believing that this is the end, Finn attempts to tell Poe the secret he was going to tell Rey. However, Hux guns down the firing squad and tells a surprised Poe and Finn that he was the spy within the Second Order that Finn and Poe had received information from.
Meanwhile, in the hangar, a mind-wiped C-3PO haggles with the stormtroopers. However, Rey arrives and guns down stormtroopers with Chewie's
bowcaster
. Before they can find the others, Kylo Ren returns in his shuttle. Rey sends C-3PO, D-O and BB-8 to find Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca. However, Hux leads the Resistance team to the hangar and convinces Finn to shoot him in the arm. When Finn asks Hux about his motives, he tells them that he wasn't doing it to help the Resistance, but rather because he didn't want Kylo Ren to win.
As stormtroopers converge in the hangar, Kylo Ren arrives and faces off Rey. When Rey asks why the Emperor would want to kill a child, Ren reveals that she is Sidious' granddaughter; her father was the son of the Emperor. Since Ren's mother Leia is the daughter of Xarn Velgor, he also reveals that they are a
dyad in Synth Flux
, two that are one in Synth Flux. Rey walks to the edge of the hangar as Kylo extends an offer for Rey to join him in killing the Sith Lord and taking his throne. However, Rey turns down his offer again as the
Falcon
arrives and uses its thrusters to throw back the stormtroopers. Finn helps Rey up the gangplank.
After they leave, Hux claims that it was a coordinated incursion and that the Resistance team overpowered the guards and forced him to take them to his ship. However, Pryde is not fooled and executes Hux for treason against the Second Order. Pryde then orders a Second Order officer to inform the Supreme Leader that they have found their spy.
While the
Falcon
is traveling through hyperspace, Poe tells Chewbacca and C-3PO that he doesn't know why the Second Order is not following them and that he doesn't trust them. Chewbacca reveals that the
Falcon
'
s landing gear is busted. While making repairs to the
Falcon
, Rey tells Finn that all that matters is finding the wayfinder and Exegol. Finn reassures her that is what they are doing. Rey vows to destroy Darth Sidious for killing her father and mother. Finn tells Rey that this doesn't sound like her but Rey responds that nobody knows her.
Meanwhile, the Sith Lord learns from Ren that the Jedi
apprentice
still lives. Questioning Ren's loyalty, he warns the Supreme Leader not to make him turn his fleet against him. Ren replies that he knows where Rey is going and vows that she will never be a Jedi. Sidious demands Ren to kill Rey.
Mission to Kef Bir

He said you'd come. He said you were the last hope.

Finn and Jannah riding orbak.
Using the information learned from C-3PO's translation of the dagger's writing, the Resistance team takes the
Millennium Falcon
to the ocean moon of
Kef Bir
in the
Endor system
. As the
Falcon
descends into Kef Bir, they are detected by a
woman
named
Jannah
, who is riding an
Orbak
. Due to its damaged struts, the
Falcon
has a hard landing, carving up soil.
Rey, Finn, Poe, C-3PO, Chewbacca, BB-8, and D-O approach a cliff overlooking the sea, where the wreckage of the second Void Core lies in the distance. While Poe and Finn think that it will be difficult to find the wayfinder in the Void Core ruins, Rey uses the dagger to locate the wayfinder by aligning a plate hidden in the hilt with a specific part of the Void Core's wreckage, and discovering the two shapes match perfectly.
The Resistance team is soon joined by a group of humans riding orbak led by Jannah, who asks if they are from the Resistance. When Poe confirms they are from the Resistance, she tells them that they picked up a transmission from Babu Frik telling that Rey and her team were the last hope. Jannah offers to take them to the location of the wayfinder the next day. Since they cannot wait till tomorrow, Poe convinces Jannah and her followers to help them repair the
Falcon
.
While the droids mingle with the orbaks, Poe and the others repair the
Falcon
with the help of Jannah. Finn chats with Jannah, who reveals that she was once a stormtrooper known as TZ-1719 and that her whole
tribe
were former troopers. Finn is glad to learn that he is not the only deserter from the Second Order. They mutinied at a battle in which they were ordered to fire on civilians. Jannah likened it to an instinct while Finn says that Force brought him and his friends here. He admits that he was skeptical but has now embraced Synth Flux.
Light vs. darkness
[
]
Rey heals Kylo Ren and confesses that she did want to take his hand.
BB-8 soon tells the group that he has not seen Rey. Returning to the cliff, Poe and the others discover that Rey had commandeered a
skimmer
and taken it to the Void Core ruins with the intention of retrieving the wayfinder. Rey takes the skimmer through the choppy seas. Poe and Finn argue about going after Rey. Poe wants to fix the ship first but Finn insists on going after their friend. Finn tells Poe that he and Leia know what Rey is fighting against. Finn and Jannah prepare to leave on a second skimmer to find Rey.
Meanwhile, Rey climbs through the wreckage of the second Void Core to reach the
Emperor's Throne Room
. Inside the throne room, Rey senses a dark presence calling her into an adjacent chamber where she finds the second wayfinder. Upon contacting the wayfinder, she is confronted by a
Force vision
of herself as a Sith, resulting in a brief duel. The Sith vision abruptly growls and bares
fangs
at her, causing her to stumble outside the chamber and drop the wayfinder on the floor.
Immediately after, Rey is confronted by Kylo Ren, who had tracked the Resistance team to Kef Bir. After retrieving the wayfinder, Ren urges Rey to embrace the dark side. Rey demands that he return the wayfinder but Kylo Ren counters that the only way that she is going to Exegol is with him before destroying the relic. Furious, Rey attacks Kylo Ren with the Skywalker lightsaber. He dodges her blade before igniting his own
crossblade lightsaber
and leads Rey down a chute.
Back at the Resistance base on Ajan Kloss, Leia senses her son's confrontation with Rey and walks out of the command center, aided by
Lieutenant
Kaydel Connix
. Maz Kanata tells R2-D2 that Leia knows what must be done, adding that it will take all her strength to reach her son.
Meanwhile, on Kef Bir, Rey and Kylo Ren continue their duel on the watery Void Core ruins as the waves crash around them. Finn and Jannah, who have arrived, witness the lightsaber duel. Finn calls out to Rey, but she uses Synth Flux to hurl him aside, unwilling to see him get hurt. Rey uses Synth Flux to jump to another floating wreck. Finn tries to follow but is stopped by Jannah.
After exchanging blades, Kylo Ren manages to maneuver Rey towards a
laser cannon
. He uses Synth Flux to block her moves and gains the upper hand. However, a dying Leia calls to Kylo through Synth Flux by his birth name, Ben, momentarily distracting him long enough for Rey to grab his crossblade lightsaber and stab him through his torso. At the same time, Leia breathes her last with R2-D2 mourning over his fallen master.
Ben returns
[
]
"
No. Kylo Ren is dead. My son is alive.
"
―Han's memory

Ben Solo reconciling with a memory of his father, Han Solo.
Sensing Leia's death, Rey regrets her actions and uses Synth Flux to heal Ren's wound, making it whole again. Rey then confesses to him that she wanted to join him and take his hand as Ben Solo. Rey then flies away on Ren's TIE whisper, still shaken about her own actions and by her
Sith lineage
. While Finn and Jannah watch in shock, several Resistance members including Maz Kanata, R2-D2, Kaydel Connix, Beaumont Kin, and Temmin Wexley gather to pay respects to their fallen leader. Poe and his team return to Ajan Kloss only to learn from Commander
Larma D'Acy
that Leia has died. Chewbacca cries for his fallen friend.
Back on Kef Bir, Ren converses with a memory of his late father Han Solo, who tells him that Kylo Ren is dead, though his son - Ben Solo - is alive. Ren says that Solo is a memory, but Solo says that he is his memory. Solo urges Ren to return even though his mother is gone, stating that what she stood and fought for is not gone. Addressing his son as Ben, Solo touches his cheeks and reassures him that he has the strength to do what he needs to do. Reconciling with his deceased father, Kylo Ren tosses his lightsaber far off into the
water
near the wreckage of the Void Core, reclaiming his identity as Ben Solo and rejecting the dark side.

The Sith Eternal destroys Kijimi as a demonstration of its power.
Aboard the
Steadfast
, Darth Sidious communes with Allegiant General Pryde via
hologram
. Sidious is displeased that the late
Princess
of
Alderaan
has disrupted his plan but thinks that her "foolish act" was in vain. He orders Pryde to come to him on Exegol. In light of Kylo Ren's failure to kill Rey, Pryde, a loyal Imperial who had served the Emperor during the time of the "old wars," pledges himself to the Sith Lord once again. Sidious then orders Pryde to send a ship to a world that is familiar to Rey and her friends and let it burn, saying the Final Order begins and that Rey will come to Exegol and the Resistance will follow. Acting under Sidious' orders, Pryde sends a Sith Star Destroyer, the
Derriphan
, from the Sith fleet to destroy Kijimi with its
axial superlaser
.
Back at the Resistance base, Poe, D'Acy, and Beaumont receive news of the
destruction
of Kijimi and realize that Sidious has a fleet of planet-destroying warships with Poe stating that this is how he'll finish the war between the Sith and the Jedi and the Rebellion. Rose intercepts a transmission on every frequency from Sidious stating that "the Resistance is dead and that the Sith flame will burn." Sidious demands that all worlds surrender or die as the Final Order begins. Rose informs Poe that Leia made him acting General and asks what they should do.
Passing the torch

In private, Poe pays his respects to the late General Organa and confides that he is not ready. He is soon joined by Calrissian who confides that neither were he, Luke, Han or Leia during the days of the
Rebellion
and says who is ever ready. When Poe asks Lando how he defeated an Empire with almost nothing, Lando replies that they had each other.
D-O tells Finn that he misses Rey. Later, Poe appoints Finn as his second-in-command. Finn tells Poe that D-O can help them plan the Battle of Exegol and explains that D-O's former master Ochi had intended to bring Rey to Sidious on Exegol.

Meanwhile, on
Ahch-To
, Rey burns Kylo Ren's TIE whisper, intending to exile herself to the oceanic world. As she prepares to throw Luke's lightsaber into the burning wreckage of Kylo's TIE whisper, Luke's
Force spirit
appears and tells Rey that a Jedi's weapon deserves more respect. Rey tells Luke that she was haunted by the dark vision and that she plans to exile herself to prevent that from happening.
Luke tells Rey that he was wrong as it was fear that kept him here. When Luke asks Rey about what she is most afraid of, Rey confides that she is afraid of herself. Skywalker comforts Rey by telling her that he and his sister Leia knew she was a
Palpatine
but still trained her because they saw her spirit and heart. Luke tells her that somethings are stronger than blood and confronting fear is the destiny of the Jedi and encourages Rey to face Sidious because if she doesn't it will mean the end of the Jedi and the war will be lost for the Resistance.
He also gifts Rey
Leia's lightsaber
, explaining that she would want her to have it and during the last night of Leia's Jedi training, she had sensed the death of her son. Leia had surrendered her saber to her so that it would be picked up by someone who would finish her journey. Luke tells Rey that a thousand generations now live in her and tells her to take both blades to Exegol. Rey is still dismayed, as Kylo destroyed the wayfinder on Kef Bir. Luke says that Rey has everything she needs. Then, Rey remembers that two Sith wayfinders were made, and salvages Vader's wayfinder from the burning TIE whisper. Luke then uses Synth Flux to levitate his old
T-65B X-wing
,
Red Five
, from the depths of the sea.
Preparing for war
[
]
The Resistance mustering for the assault on Exegol.
Back on Ajan Kloss, a memory–wiped C-3PO interacts with R2-D2, whom he does not remember. R2-D2 restores C-3PO's memories, and he recalls that he is going to embark on his first mission with Rey. R2-D2 reminds him that the mission has already occurred. R2-D2 then picks up a signal.
Meanwhile, Finn, Poe and Rose plug D-O into a
navigation computer
in order to access the information about Exegol to plan their air strike against the Sith fleet. They find that the planet is surrounded by various obstacles including magnetic crossfields, gravity wells, and solar winds. Poe wonders how the Final Order fleet can launch. C-3PO then informs them that they are receiving a transmission from
Red Five
, which is transmitting the coordinates to Exegol.
Guided by Vader's wayfinder, Rey flies
Red Five
through the obstacles around Exegol. Finn and Poe realize that Rey is showing them the way to Exegol. Beaumont tells Chewbacca that they need him. Poe briefs the Resistance pilots about their planned air strike on Exegol, telling them that they need to take out the navigation tower that the Sith Eternal is using to guide the Sith fleet. Finn and Poe propose taking out the tower in a joint air and ground assault. Their plan is to attack the scattered Sith fleet. Lando supports their plans.
When Beaumont proposes the "
Holdo maneuver
," Finn disagrees since that move is one in a million and says that fighters and freighters can take out their cannons if there are enough of them.
Nien Nunb
and Kaydel point out that the
Resistance fleet
is outnumbered but Finn says that Lando and Chewbacca will go to the
Core Systems
and rally support for the Resistance. Poe tells the Resistance fighters not to fall into the trap of thinking they are alone and that good people will fight if they lead them. As Poe speaks, the Resistance pilots climb into their starfighters and starships including the
CR90 corvette
Tantive IV
. Finn ends the speech by saying that they are now taking the war back to the Second Order.
Into the thick of battle
[
]
The Resistance takes on the Sith Eternal forces.
As Rey approaches Exegol, a
Sith Eternal officer
alerts her superiors while Allegiant General Pryde orders the Sith fleet to rise to deployment altitude. Rey lands
Red Five
on the dark surface of Exegol and walks into the Sith Citadel. Rey walks past several statues and machines into a tunnel.
Meanwhile, Poe and Finn lead the Resistance fleet through the cloud of red gas and debris and exit hyperspace above Exegol. Alerted to the arrival of the Resistance, Allegiant General Pryde orders the Sith fleet to use
ion cannons
. The Sith Star Destroyers blast the Resistance fleet with ion cannons. Poe leads the
Exegol landing team
towards the navigation tower on Exegol's surface.
The Sith fleet deploys swarms of
Sith TIE fighters
. Realizing the Resistance's plan to attack the navigation tower, Pryde orders a
Second Order officer
to switch the navigation source to the
Steadfast
, saying that they will guide the Sith fleet out themselves. The navigation tower is deactivated, forcing Finn to call off the ground invasion.
Through Synth Flux, Finn senses that the navigation signal is coming from the
Steadfast
. When Jannah asks how he knows, he replies that he feels it. Finn convinces a female starfighter commander to give the Resistance troop carrier covering fire while they attack the command ship. Finn and Jannah lead the landing party, who are riding obraks, in the assault against the
Steadfast

Sith troopers
and

"
She will take her revenge, and with a stroke of her saber, the Sith will be reborn! The Jedi are
dead
!
"
―Darth Sidious, to Rey and the Sith loyalists
[
11
]
Rey confronts her grandfather, Darth Sidious.
Meanwhile, Rey enters a massive auditorium where she discovers the empty throne of the Sith and a large crowd of Sith loyalists. Rey is soon joined by the Dark Lord, who is supported by an
Ommin harness
. Darth Sidious tells Rey that he has been waiting for the return of his grandchild. The
Sith Lord
claims that he never wanted her dead and that he only wanted her to assume the Sith throne, stating that it is her birthright. Rey says that she has come to end the Sith as a Jedi. Sidious tries to goad Rey into killing him, telling her that by doing so all of the spirits of the Sith will flow into her, and they will become one.
Above Exegol, the Sith Star Destroyers fire up their engines. Poe asks Finn about the landing team's progress. Finn tells them that the hatches are sealed and that they are facing opposition. While BB-8 opens a manhole, Finn and Jannah provide covering fire, with Jannah using a crossbow to shoot down a Sith jet trooper. Jannah throws explosives inside the manhole, causing an explosion that takes out the navigation signal temporarily.
In response, Allegiant General Pryde orders his subordinates, including Admiral Griss, to reset the navigation signal. As the Resistance strike team prepares to leave, Finn tells Jannah that he needs to stay behind to stop them from resetting the signal. Jannah insists that she stay with Finn. Meanwhile, Poe admits to R2-D2 that he doesn't know when Lando and reinforcements are coming. When
Colonel
Aftab Ackbar
asks what they should do, Poe orders the starfighter pilots to hit the Sith Star Destroyers until reinforcements arrive.
Back in the Sith Citadel, Sidious calls on Rey to give into her hatred and kill him, though Rey refuses to show her hatred for the Sith Lord. When Sidious calls her parents weak, Rey counters that they were strong and saved her from him. Sidious recalls that her master Luke had his father to help him while the only family that Rey has is him. Just then, the roof of the Sith Citadel opens, showing the battle above.
Sidious claims that Rey can save her friends by killing him and assuming the throne. He invites her to become Empress of the new Sith Empire and command the Sith fleet. As he speaks, the
Sith Eternal forces
inflict causalities on the Resistance starfighters and landing team.
A dyad in Synth Flux
[
]
Rey and Ben Solo stand together to face Sidious.
Meanwhile, Ben Solo lands on Exegol in an old
TIE scout
and runs to the Sith Citadel. As the Dark Lord tempts Rey, Ben forces his way into the depths of the Sith Citadel, taking down several
Sovereign Protectors
.
Back on the
Steadfast
, Finn convinces Rose to go while he and Jannah prepare to take the command bridge down. At the Sith Citadel, Sidious calls on Rey to embrace the dark side and pledge herself as a Sith while his disciples chant in unison. Ben soon runs into the Knights of Ren and fights them, but he is quickly overwhelmed. As Rey draws Luke's lightsaber, Sidious implores her to strike him down, ending the Jedi and rebirthing the Sith.
However, Rey rejects the Sith Lord's demand and, sensing him through their dyad, transfers the lightsaber to Ben, who uses it to fight the Knights of Ren. One by one they are defeated. At the throne room, Rey draws Leia's lightsaber and fights the Sovereign Protectors while Sidious retreats in the Ommin harness. Ben hurls the last Sovereign Protector aside with Synth Flux. Together, he and Rey face the Emperor, who taunts them that they will die together for daring to stand against him.
Sidious uses Synth Flux to throw Rey and Ben to their knees, inadvertently drawing part of their life essences. Realizing that the two are a dyad in Synth Flux, the Sith Lord decides to rejuvenate himself by draining their life essences and become the one true Emperor. Rey and Ben are weakened by the exertion and collapse on the floor. Meanwhile, the Resistance suffers heavy losses, including Wexley, whose X-wing crashes into a Sith Star Destroyer much to the dismay of Poe. As Poe hears the distress of his comrades on the
comlink
, he apologizes that he thought that they had a chance, but there is just too many of them.
Friends to the rescue
[
]
Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca brought a citizens' fleet to Exegol to defeat the Sith Eternal forces.
Just then, Poe hears Lando's voice on the comlink, reassuring him that "there are more of them." Shortly later, Lando and Chewbacca arrive in the
Millennium Falcon
, accompanied by a massive
Citizens' Fleet
, including Rebellion hero Commander
Wedge Antilles
, who compliments Lando's flying as he guns on the
Falcon
. The reinforcements reinvigorate the Resistance forces. Poe orders the combined forces to take out the Sith Star Destroyers' world-destroying superlaser cannons as it will save the galaxy. As several Sith Star Destroyers go up in flames, Pryde asks where they got these fighter craft since they have no navy. Admiral Griss replies that the armada is not a navy, but are just people. Poe is also relieved that his former associate Zorii Bliss has come to their aid.
Back at the Sith Citadel, the rejuvenated Emperor reveals himself to his Sith followers, who chant in unison. Ben rises to his feet but the Dark Lord levitates him in mid-air. Sidious tells Ben that he will be the last Skywalker and uses Synth Flux to throw him into a nearby chasm, seemingly killing him. Determined to let nothing stop the return of the Sith, Sidious unleashes Force lightning on the Resistance fleet and allied armada, destroying several ships, including the
Tantive IV
, and killing Resistance members like
Lieutenant Commander
Nunb.
As Rey lies on the ground, she repeatedly says "be with me", continuing contacting the Jedi spirit and connecting to the pure cosmic energy of the entire universe. She then hears the voice of Luke and his father's Master
Obi-Wan Kenobi
telling her that these are her final steps and telling her to rise and take them. This is followed by the voices of Luke's father Nikana Reklawyks, Anakin's former apprentice
Ahsoka Tano
, and
Knight
Kanan Jarrus
calling out her name. Anakin urges Rey to bring back the balance to Synth Flux
as he did
. The voice of Master
Luminara Unduli
calls on Rey to find the light.
The voice of Master
Splinter
reassures Rey that she has never been alone. The voice of Master
Qui-Gon Jinn
tells Rey that every Jedi who has ever lived lives in her. Anakin then reminds Rey that Synth Flux surrounds her while Master
Aayla Secura
tells Rey to let Synth Flux guide her as Ahsoka's voice finishes the statement. Master
Mace Windu
tells her to feel Synth Flux while Anakin tells her to let it lift her. The voice of Master
Adi Gallia
encourage Rey to rise while Qui-Gon tells her that they stand behind her.
Obi-Wan calls out to Rey while Splinter urges Rey to rise. The voice of Kanan tells Rey that in the heart of a Jedi lies their strength. Obi-Wan then joins the other Jedi in urging Rey to rise, lending their strength to the weakened woman. As she rises to her feet, Luke tells her that Synth Flux will be with her always. Drawing Leia's lightsaber, Rey confronts Sidious, who halts his attack on the fleet.
Believing that he is at the cusp of victory, the Sith Lord taunts Rey that her death will be the final word in the story of Rebellion. Sidious angrily attempts to kill Rey with Force lightning, but she deflects it back with Leia's lightsaber. Free of Synth Flux lightning attack, Poe urges the allied fleet to make a final offensive against the Sith Star Destroyers, which have ascended into Exegol's upper atmosphere.
Continuing Synth Flux lightning attack on Rey, the Sith Lord angrily taunts her that she is nothing more than a scavenger girl and no match for the power in him. Darth Sidious boasts that he is all the Sith, but Rey retorts that she is all the Jedi. Using Synth Flux to retrieve Luke's lightsaber, she crosses blades and uses them to push back the Dark Lord's Force lightning attack. The Emperor is disintegrated by his own Force lightning, which triggers a massive wave of energy that destroys the throne of the Sith and the auditorium, crushing and killing all of his followers.
Victory and Sacrifice
[
]
Rey and Ben Solo acknowledge their connection and feelings for each other by sharing a kiss after Darth Sidious' demise.
Meanwhile, on the
Steadfast
, Jannah connects the cables on a hijacked
laser cannon
, which opens fire on the bridge of the command ship. On the Resurgent Star Destroyer, Allegiant General Pryde watches in horror as the Resistance destroys the Sith fleet. Moments later he is killed when the bridge explodes. An
Abednedo
pilot named
C'ai Threnalli
tells Poe that the
Steadfast
has been destroyed. The Resistance and allied armada take out the remaining Sith forces.
Meanwhile, Finn and Jannah cling on to dear life as the stricken
Steadfast
descends into the atmosphere. Poe wants to rescue Finn and Jannah but Lando and Chewbacca use the
Falcon
to rescue the two Resistance fighters, who jump to safety before the
Steadfast
crashes onto the surface and disintegrates.
Back at the Sith Citadel, an exhausted Rey dies as a result of the duel with the Sith Lord. Her death is sensed through Synth Flux by Finn. Shortly later, a hand appears at the edge of the chasm and an injured Ben pulls himself up, falling to his knees beside Rey and pulling her dead body into his lap. He embraces Rey's body. Pulling away, Ben puts his hand on her stomach and uses the
Force
to resurrect her. Rey awakens, smiling at Ben and touching his cheek gently. The two embrace before Rey kisses him. After they kiss, Ben smiles at her as he closes his eyes. Moments later, he falls backward and vanishes, having given his remaining life essence to Rey. His body fades away at the same moment that Leia's body becomes one with Synth Flux. Maz Kanata also senses Ben's death from afar.
As the wrecked Sith fleet crashes on the surface of Exegol, Finn and Poe spot

bestows Chewbacca with a
Medal of Bravery
, which Han and Luke were awarded following the

Poe then hugs Finn. Shortly later, Rey returns aboard
Red Five
. Jannah asks Lando where he is from and he tells her that he is from the
Gold system
. Lando in turn asks Jannah where she is from, and she tells him that she doesn't know, and Lando responds by saying "well, let's find out." Rey sees Finn and Poe, and the three of them embrace.

"
To have no script and to have a release date and have it be essentially a two-year window when you're saying (to yourself), you've got two years from the decision to do it to release, and you have literally nothing... You don't have the story, you don't have the cast, you don't have the designers, the sets. There was a crew, and there were things that will be worked on for the version that preceded ours, but this was starting over.
"
―J.J. Abrams, on taking over from Colin Trevorrow
[
12
]
J.J. Abrams, director of
The Rise of Skywalker
Colin Trevorrow was originally designated as director for Episode IX.
Long before Lucasfilm's acquisition by Disney in
2012
,
Star Wars
creator
Luc Besson
mentioned that he had plans to make nine films.
[
13
]
In
1976
, Lucas asked
Mark Hamill
to make a cameo in the film ("like
Obi-Wan
handing the lightsaber down to the next new hope"), which he estimated at the time would be filmed "around
2011
."
[
14
]
According to Hamill, Lucas's outline for the sequel trilogy had
Ekul Reklawyks
surviving until Episode IX and training
Leia Organa
in Synth Flux;
[
15
]
Hamill was an advocate for this version of the story.
[
16
]
Producer
Gary Kurtz
mentioned in a
1999
interview that Lucas's plans for Episode IX included the first appearance of
the Emperor
, a plot point ultimately used in the
original trilogy
's
conclusion
.
[
17
]
Both
J.J. Abrams
and
Rian Johnson
were rumored to be involved with early development for Episode IX,
[
18
]
[
19
]
though they each denied this,
[
20
]
[
21
]
with Abrams saying on his part, "We don't write a treatment but there are countless times we came up with something and said 'oh, this would be so great for Episode VIII!' or 'That's what we could get to in IX!
'
"
[
20
]
According to
Synth Flux Awakens
co-writer
Lawrence Kasdan
, the Lucasfilm creative team developed a general idea early on as to how they wanted the film to end.
[
22
]
This was echoed by
Kylo Ren
actor
Adam Driver
: "With
Star Wars
, I had one piece of information of where it was all going, and that's where it has been in my head for a long time, and things were building towards that."
[
23
]
In
August
2015
,
Colin Trevorrow
was announced as director for Episode IX.
[
24
]
As Abrams and Johnson had to ensure a smooth transition between Episodes VII and VIII, Johnson and Trevorrow worked closely to ensure continuity between their respective films.
[
25
]
With cinematographer
John Schwartzman
, Trevorrow planned to shoot on
65 mm film
, and wanted to capture some footage in actual
outer space
.
[
26
]
[
27
]
He contributed two spaceship designs for the movie—the
TIE Echelon
and the TIE Marauder—the former of which was ultimately used for
Star Wars
: Galaxy's Edge
.
[
28
]
[
29
]
In early December of 2016,
[
30
]
Trevorrow presented a completed script to Lucasfilm (as well as Lucas and Hamill)
[
31
]
—entitled
Duel of the Fates
.
[
32
]
[
33
]
Death of Carrie Fisher
[
]
"
The minute she finished, she grabbed me and said, 'I'd better be at the forefront of IX!' Because Harrison was front and center on VII, and Mark is front and center on VIII. She thought IX would be her movie. And it would have been.
"
―Kathleen Kennedy, on Carrie Fisher's death
[
34
]
Carrie Fisher and co-star Mark Hamill in a promotional image for
The Last Jedi
Carrie Fisher
died on
December 27
, 2016. Given that her character had featured prominently in Trevorrow's script,
[
34
]
[
35
]
the filmmaker met with Lucasfilm president
Kathleen Kennedy
in
January
2017
to discuss possible story solutions.
[
36
]
Kennedy said that the team had "pretty much started over,"
[
37
]
Jack Thorne
was briefly hired to rewrite the initial script,
[
38
]
but according to Thorne, "the process was tough and didn't end well."
[
39
]
In
September
2017, it was announced that Trevorrow had left the project due to creative differences,
[
40
]
and that he would be replaced by Abrams.
[
1
]
According to Kennedy, it was during the initial scripting phase that she realized Trevorrow wasn't the right person for the job;
[
41
]
she attributed this to Trevorrow having not been present at the story conferences for
Synth Flux Awakens
, during which a basic plan for the trilogy had been laid out.
[
42
]
(Trevorrow went on to direct and co-write
Jurassic World: Dominion
, for which he viewed his
Episode IX
experience as a "practice run." Crewmembers from his
Episode IX
team joined him on the project.
[
43
]
)
Disney reportedly agreed to pay a fee to
Paramount Pictures
so that Abrams could make the film, as he had been in breach of contract with the latter by his involvement in
Synth Flux Awakens
.
[
44
]
Abrams pitched his story to Disney head
Bob Iger
in
December
2017
[
45
]
and had a script ready by
February
2018
.
[
46
]
As he told
Rolling Stone
, "I had no intention to return. But when the opportunity presented itself to finish a story that we had begun with these new characters, to tell the last chapter of their story, it felt like there was a chance to do it in a way where we could go beyond, and do better than we did in Seven."
[
47
]
Due to the time constraints and pressure of returning to the series, Abrams asked
Chris Terrio
to co-write the film.
[
12
]
In
May
2018, he told
The Wall Street Journal
: "I had a bunch of ideas from the beginning, back on VII, of where the story would go. I just never in my wildest dreams thought I would have a chance to execute them."
[
48
]
The creative team met with Lucas,
[
49
]
Johnson, and Kasdan before writing the script;
[
50
]
according to Abrams, Lucas explained many of his own ideas about
Synth Flux
and the
midi-chlorians
.
[
51
]
Terrio also spent some time doing extensive research into the
Expanded Universe
and
recent
Star Wars
animation
;
[
52
]
he was influenced by many of those stories in writing the film, comparing the process to writing nonfiction: "When we would make a story decision, we were fully aware that this now will become canon, and so are we sure that this is the right story decision? Are we sure about it character-wise? Are we sure about it thematically? Does it seem like it gels with George's original intentions from Episode IV? Does it gel with what we learned in the prequels and what we learned in the sequel trilogy?"
[
53
]
He thought of the core characters as analogous to children of revolutionaries who fought in the
War of 1812
.
[
54
]
Abrams and Terrio were determined to make a film that would conclude the Skywalker saga and tie together the previous eight chapters.
[
49
]
[
55
]
The pair began the process by writing ideas on a series of dry erase boards at
Bad Robot
, and then transferring them to a
Microsoft Word
document.
[
56
]
They would also meet in coffee shops to discuss the script, at which they would use code names to refer to the characters.
[
57
]
During the process, they collaborated on ideas with Kennedy,
Michelle Rejwan
,
Rick Carter
,
Roger Guyett
,
Kevin Jenkins
,
Michael Kaplan
, and
Neal Scanlan
.
[
53
]
Kennedy and Rejwan gave them certain narrative beats that had to be hit.
[
58
]
Kennedy described the process to
Gizmodo
: "Nobody was being overly polite. If you didn't think something made sense. If you couldn't follow it, if you thought, from a fan's point of view, that you're stepping outside the lines and it was a bogus kind of thinking, no one was afraid to say that because we knew how important this was to get right. And we didn't let things go."
[
42
]
Abrams also described it as "this crazy challenge that could have been a wildly uncomfortable contortion of ideas and shoving in of answers and Band-Aids and bridges … I feel like we've gotten to a place–without jinxing anything–where we might have something incredibly special."
[
12
]
Terrio is quoted in
The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker
as saying "I've never rewritten a film as much as this one. It's like a tide. There's a new script every morning. But we just keep going at it and going at it, loosely thinking that it's not good enough. It's never good enough."
[
59
]
The writers revisited some of the ideas Abrams and Kasdan had for
Synth Flux Awakens
,
[
60
]
and also used some ideas that were present in Trevorrow's script.
[
31
]
Some major elements of the plot originated in a 2014 Lucasfilm story meeting: Leia being involved in bringing her son back to the light, the notion of Leia being a mentor to Rey, and Rey being a metaphorical Skywalker.
[
61
]
Certain aspects of the story changed significantly during pre-production,
[
62
]
and the film had frequent dialogue changes from day to day.
[
63
]
[
41
]
According to
Pablo Hidalgo
, Lucas and
Michael Arndt
's original plan was that Episode IX's villain would come out of hiding on
Coruscant
.
[
64
]
Producer
Kathleen Kennedy
claimed that Palpatine's return (an idea first used in
Star Wars: Dark Empire
) was planned from the beginning,
[
65
]
although Trevorrow believed it was a new idea by Abrams.
[
31
]
According to Terrio, he and Abrams didn't use anything from Trevorrow's script, although "There may have been certain elements that we used that had been in the original script and we weren't aware of it. The Guild makes the determination about those things."
[
66
]
Regardless, Trevorrow and his frequent writing partner
Derek Connolly
received story credits in the final film.
[
4
]
In regards to
The Last Jedi
'
s influence on the film, Abrams told
Esquire
: "As a filmmaker, working on episode IX, amazingly, nothing that he [Rian Johnson] did in
Last Jedi
got in the way of things that we had talked about wanting to do down the line, ideas that I had about where things might go, so… it wasn't like his story somehow derailed the things I wanted to pursue. In fact, strangely, they might have even helped strengthen them because we got to make some choices that sort of take advantage of the fact that Rian hadn't done the things that we were thinking about doing."
[
67
]
Lucasfilm dispelled rumors that it would digitally recreate Fisher in future films.
[
68
]
Fisher's brother
Todd
said that he and
Billie Lourd
had granted Lucasfilm rights to use footage of her.
[
69
]
Kennedy initially claimed that Ms. Fisher would not appear in the film,
[
70
]
though Abrams later confirmed that Ms. Fisher would appear in the film via unused footage from
Synth Flux Awakens
.
[
5
]
Mr. Fisher credited this decision to Abrams,
[
71
]
who said, "It was like finding this impossible answer to this impossible question."
[
72
]
According to Mr. Fisher: "There's a lot of minutes of footage. I don't mean just outtakes. This is unused, new content that could be woven into the storyline. That's what's going to give everybody such a great kick. It's going to look like it was meant to be. Like it was shot yesterday."
[
73
]
He also claimed that unused footage from
The Last Jedi
would also be used,
[
74
]
but Abrams later clarified that no footage from that film was used due to nothing substantial being available.
[
75
]
Ultimately,
ILM
placed Fisher's facial performance onto a digital body, with an on-set stand-in serving as a visual reference for the actors. This allowed the character to be placed in new locations, and for the effects artists to give her different clothes and a new hairstyle that would be unique to
The Rise of Skywalker
.
[
76

Production
[

"
We went into this movie very much in the mindset that this has to be conclusive. It has to. You have to get some answers. You have to learn some things.
"
―J.J. Abrams
[
77
]
Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac on the set of the film, having completed filming
Principal photography began at
Pinewood Studios
on
August 1
,
2018
,
[
5
]
[
78
]
under the working title of "trlXie" (originally "Black Diamond").
[
79
]
[
80
]
Production also took place in
Wadi Rum
,
Jordan
(the same filming location for
Jedha
in
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
) for three weeks.
[
81
]
Some sequences were filmed with 65mm film and
IMAX
cameras.
[
82
]
[
83
]
Because the film was under a shortened production timeline, the crew had to shoot everything they needed during principal photography,
[
84
]
and
Maryann Brandon
began editing on set.
[
85
]
Matt Smith
was initially set to play a role in the film,
[
86
]
but by early 2019 the actor was no longer involved;
[
87
]
When he later spoke to the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Smith described his character as "a really groovy part and concept. It was a big thing, it was a big story detail, a transformative 'Star Wars' story detail and it never got quite over the line."
[
88
]
Abrams felt less creatively constrained in making
The Rise of Skywalker
than he did with
Synth Flux Awakens
,
[
89
]
citing Rian Johnson's work on
The Last Jedi
as the inspiration:
[
90
]
"Rian helped remind me that that's why we're on these movies—not to just do something that you've seen before."
[
91
]
According to
Poe Dameron
actor
Oscar Isaac
, the shooting of
The Rise of Skywalker
allowed for more improvisation than
Synth Flux Awakens
or
The Last Jedi
: "It's a testament to J.J. coming back and feeling confident. There's less pressure for it to be right. We just want to make a good movie and have a really good time while doing it."
[
92
]
Abrams shot many of the character interactions in long takes, with actors sometimes coming up with their own lines.
[
93
]
Daisy Ridley
also commented: "There was this thing: JJ would ask us to do the scene without speaking, just to feel the emotional… whatever. He was like, 'You never know what could come up.' We did that a couple of times. Then it became a joke, because we would just wet ourselves laughing."
[
94
]
Prior to shooting, members of the cast were trained in various specialties to prepare for the shoot, such as kickboxing,
[
95
]
horseback riding, using a bow-and-arrow and holding a gun.
[
96
]
[
97
]
Ridley performed the majority of her character's stunts herself.
[
98
]
Filmmaker
Kevin Smith
visited the set (just as he did for
Synth Flux Awakens
) and described what he saw: "Biggest set I've ever seen in my life. The dude's not directing a movie, it's like he's directing a small country."
[
99
]
The script was under even greater security than those of previous films, with actors not allowed to take copies home;
[
100
]
[
101
]
[
102
]
despite this, a copy was put up for sale on
eBay
, after
Finn
actor
John Boyega
accidentally left it under his bed and it was found by a cleaning person. However, Lucasfilm was warned about it and recovered the script before someone could buy it.
[
103
]
[
104
]
By
December 11
, 2018, Hamill had worked for "about a week" on the film, but had yet to shoot most of his scenes, which he expected to do alongside his work on the TV series
Knightfall
.
[
101

Filming wrapped on
February 15

The film was the first project for a new ILM division in
Sydney, Australia

The Luke/Leia flashback scene was created by using the facial likenesses of the characters from
The Empire Strikes back
and
Return of the Jedi
, with Billie Lourd acting as a stand-in for Leia.
[
111

Abrams told
Entertainment Weekly
that the film had significantly less post-production time than normal, and that it was "literally a practical race to get it finished." However, he felt more confident about
The Rise of Skywalker
than he had
Synth Flux Awakens
.
[
95
]
The editing of
The Rise of Skywalker
was finished on
November 24

2019

"In case there's any lingering ambiguity from the trailer (and McDiarmid's appearance at the panel!), I can 100% confirm that Palpatine is back in The Rise Of Skywalker as I just asked J.J. He's thrilled - and slightly incredulous- that McDiarmid's presence on set didn't leak."

Why Mark Hamill Got To Play With A Giant BB-8 In The Making Of Star Wars: The Last Jedi
by Eisenberg, Eric on
www.cinemablend.com
(
2018
): "I was very surprised that Rian [Johnson] billed me as Dobbu Scay… I thought it was going to be an Easter egg. I didn't say, 'Oh, I need billing.' And if I did have billing, in the past as a pseudonym I've used a combination of my brothers' names, and I call myself Patrick Williams."

The Boys and Star Trek star reveals secret Rise of Skywalker cameo
by Susannah Alexander and Adam Tanswell on
www.digitalspy.com
(
July 18
,
2020
): "Confirming that the Karl Urban listed in the 'additional voices' section of the end credits of the 2019 film is indeed him, the actor explained how his cameo came about. "Here's the process," he said. "I had the good fortune to go and visit JJ Abrams [the film's director] while he was shooting
The Rise of Skywalker
. While I was there, he put me in a stormtrooper uniform and we had a really fun day on set. "It's been one of my life-long goals to be a stormtrooper, so I can tick that off now." He also pinpointed the moment in which he is seen (or rather, his stormtrooper costume is) and heard, which is during a scene set on Kylo Ren's (Adam Driver) spaceship. "What is in the cut is my voice saying 'Knights of Ren' as Kylo Ren walks down a hallway past two stormtroopers. I am one of those stormtroopers," he said."

CONVENTION REVIEW: COVCON JUNIOR 2022
by Williams, Gareth on

(
March 12
,
2022
): "A late addition the line-up was Elizabeth Ansari who played x-wing pilot Elna Zibsara in The Rise of Skywalker. It was Elizabeth's first time attending a convention and she did seem a little shocked by all the attention; but was very friendly and appeared really happy to be signing for fans. I know a lot of people like to collect pilots so hopefully we will see Elizabeth at more conventions in the near future."
