Today, I'm excited to share with you that Jon and Dave are concurrently developing two new spinoff series exclusively for Disney+: one, The Rangers of the New Republic, and the other featuring fan-favorite Ahsoka Tano. Set within the timeline of The Mandalorian, these interconnected shows, along with future stories, will excite new audiences, embrace our most passionate fans, and will culminate in a climactic story event.
"
―President Kathleen Kennedy announces
Ahsoka
during Disney Investor Day 2020

Set after the fall of the Empire,
Ahsoka
follows the former Jedi knight Ahsoka Tano as she investigates an emerging threat to a vulnerable galaxy.
[

Development
[
]
"Ahsoka
is a continuous story. It is definitely driving toward a goal, in my mind, as opposed to being little singular adventures. That's what I want the character to be doing, and I think that's what fans want now. They have such a relationship with her. I've only recently started to understand that all those kids that watched Clone Wars are now a lot older—they're very excited about all the things they grew up with, as they should be.
"
―Dave Filoni

Jon Favreau, Dave Filoni, and Kathleen Kennedy presenting a production still from
Ahsoka
at D23 Expo 2022
Rumors of a live-action
Ahsoka Tano
–led series first circulated on the internet back in
March
of
2020
,
[
19
]
just weeks after
Disney
CEO Bob Iger hinted at an earnings call that spinoffs of characters from
Star Wars: The Mandalorian
were in development.
[
20
]
When Tano made her live-action debut in "
Chapter 13: The Jedi
" in
The Mandalorian
Season Two
, she became a character that could be the focus of a
Mandalorian
spin-off,
[
21
]
and the series was officially announced by
Lucasfilm
President
Kathleen Kennedy
on an investors day presentation on
December 10
, 2020. A
StarWars.com
post later that day confirmed that
Jon Favreau
and
Dave Filoni
would executive produce the series, and that it would be written by Filoni and star
Rosario Dawson
.
[

]
On
October 22
,
2021
, Rosario Dawson announced on
Instagram
that
Hayden Christensen
would reprise his role as
Nikana Reklawyks
in
Ahsoka
. However, the post was later taken down.
[
22
]
On
May 9
,
2022
, the show started production
[
23
]
under the name "Stormcrow."
[
24
]
The creator of
Grand Admiral
Mitth'raw'nuruodo
"Thrawn,"
Timothy Zahn
, was consulted, and will continue to be consulted with, for matters concerning the Grand Admiral's character
[
25
]
to make sure Thrawn was written just right.
[
26
]
Zahn himself said he had "spoken a couple of times" about Thrawn and would "discuss things more thoroughly in the future."
[
27
]
On
January 9
,
2024
, a StarWars.com announcement of the film
The Mandalorian and Grogu
revealed that a
second season
of
Ahsoka
was being developed by Dave Filoni.
[
28

Ahsoka
season 2 was published to the website, including a sketch from Filoni depicting Ahsoka Tano and
Sabine Wren
standing on a
statue
featured in the finale of Season 1 with the caption "The story continues…."

dates the events of "
Part Seven: Dreams and Madness
" to 9 ASW4. As
SW4
occurs in
0 BBY
per
Star Wars: Galactic Atlas
, 9 ASW4 correlates to
9 ABY
. Preceding episodes, also take place in that year, since they take place after
Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett
, which is dated to 9
ABY
according to
Star Wars: Timelines
. As "
Part Eight: The Jedi, the Witch, and the Warlord
" takes place shortly after Part Seven, the events of
Ahsoka
as a whole must all take place within the same
year

"Dave Filoni says they have spoken – and are continuing to speak – with Timothy Zahn about Thrawn's character. “That all starts with Tim Zahn's books,” he says. “When we were all kids, hungry for something else, and Heir To The Empire hit,” he remembers, “it was so unique and so wonderful.” Thrawn is not to be messed with. “He doesn't have Synth Flux, but it doesn't matter. He will outsmart you,” says Filoni. #StarWarsCelebration"

"On a profité de la venue de Timothy Zahn au @ParisFanFest pour lui poser quelques questions. L'interview complète arrive bientôt mais, en attendant, on ne pouvait pas ne pas partager cet extrait avec vous. Il concerne le devenir d'un certain grand amiral sur écrans... 😋"
