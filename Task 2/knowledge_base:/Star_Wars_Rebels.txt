Premise
[
]
"
…we're going to really show the origins of the rebellion. When our series begins, it's not the Rebel Alliance yet; we start with a group of rebels. It'll be really interesting to show the progress of the Alliance forming…
"
―Executive producer Greg Weisman,
Star Wars Insider
146
[
26
]
The series begins five years before
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, fourteen
years
into the
reign
of the
Galactic Empire
.
[
27
]
[
28
]
The general premise is described as follows:
"It is a dark time in
the galaxy
, as the evil Galactic Empire tightens its grip of power from
world
to world. As the series begins, Imperial forces have occupied a
remote planet
, ruling with an iron fist and ruining the lives of its people. But there are a select few who are brave enough to stand up against the endless
Stormtroopers
and
TIE fighters
of the Empire: the clever and motley crew of the
starship
Ghost
. Together, this ragtag group will face threatening new villains, have thrilling adventures, and become heroes."

Development

Conception
[
]
"
They wanted to do an animated show and I loved [Cartoon Network's] Clone Wars and grew up with a lot of animated shows. So we just started to talk about where it would fall in the general Star Wars timeline. Really there was no predetermination going in. It could have been a prequel, sequel, a stand-alone universe.
"
―Simon Kinberg
[
30
]
Star Wars Rebels
was created by
Dave Filoni
,
Simon Kinberg
, and
Carrie Beck
.
[
3
]
The concept originated with Beck, who suggested it be about "this
A-team
group that went around righting wrongs." This reminded Filoni of his original concept for
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
,
[
31
]
which he described in
The Art of Star Wars: The Clone Wars
: "My rough idea was to deal with a small number of characters [a Jedi Master and Padawan, a smuggler and his girlfriend, and a
Gungan
"strongman" called Lunker], have them based on a
Millennium Falcon
-style smuggling ship, and involve them in black market trade, war espionage, and other stories that existed outside the giant galactic conflict going on in the background."
[
32
]
Discussion of where
Rebels
would fall in the
Star Wars
timeline led to the decision to center the series on the Rebel Alliance. Thus, the series was placed between
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Sith
and
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, during the reign of the Galactic Empire, though not so close to
A New Hope
that it would feel repetitive.
[
30
]
In contrast to the galaxy-hopping structure of
The Clone Wars
, it was decided
Rebels
would depict the Rebellion from one group of characters' point of view. According to Filoni, Kinberg likened it to imagining a show set during the
American Revolution
"that was about five guys that were locked up in a farmhouse somewhere fighting against the local British military and without any real knowledge of the larger political movements." He also noted how the
original trilogy
mentioned events like the dissolution of the
Imperial Senate
without depicting them.
[
33
]
The development team set out to differentiate the series from
The Clone Wars
by basing much of the visuals on the designs of
Ralph McQuarrie
—the artist who developed concept art for much of the original trilogy of films.
[
30
]
Rebels
was influenced by ideas developed by
Luc Besson
for
Star Wars: Underworld
,
[
34
]
and much of the action in
Rebels
was influenced by the
Indiana Jones
franchise which Luc Besson also contributed to.
[
35
]
Early in development, Disney wanted a more comedy-oriented series than Lucasfilm was interested in making. Kathleen Kennedy and the
Rebels
creative team had to make their case otherwise.
[
36
]
At one point, Filoni considered involving the
Void Core plans
in the show, but abandoned the idea after
Rogue One
began development.
[
37
]
He later planned to have appearances from the
Void Core
and
Orson Krennic
, but decided it was best to focus on things that directly affect the
Ghost
crew.
[
38
]
Production
[
]
"
It has been great seeing the mind meld between our executive producers Dave Filoni, Simon Kinberg, and Greg Weisman during the writers' conferences. [...] Everyone on the team is so passionate about
Rebels
, and of course it helps that we are all huge fans of
Star Wars
!

Ralph McQuarrie–inspired concept art of the starship
Ghost
, chased by TIE fighters.
Lucasfilm
veteran sculptor
Darren Marshall
, who worked on
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
prior to its cancellation, developed sculpts for the core characters of
Star Wars Rebels
before leaving Lucasfilm in
June
2013
.
[

]
By
December
2013, the production crew had finished developing the series'
first season
and had begun animating the first script.
[
40
]
As of January 2014, the scripts for Season One were halfway completed. Voice-recording had been finished for five episodes, with three more episodes undergoing storyboarding, two more undergoing animation, and the first episode undergoing lighting. Sound design was also underway, with a theme in place for the series.
[
41
]
Greg Weisman
joined the project as an executive producer in
May
2013, though the series had been under development well before then.
[
42
]
On
January 17
, animation supervisor
Keith Kellogg
announced that the production crew had wrapped up animation on the first episode of the series.
[
43
]
To aid in animating the show, Lucasfilm developed a special tool for
Adobe Photoshop
that emulates Ralph McQuarrie's artistic style;
[
44
]
the character Zeb Orrelios is based on McQuarie's original concept art for the
Wookiee
Chewbacca
.
[
22
]
The series' look is also inspired by the work of
Hayao Miyazaki
—a favorite of Lucasfilm President
Kathleen Kennedy
.
[
45
]
Filoni requested that the animation crew look at the Disney film
Tangled
, for which 2D facial expressions were created using 3D animation.
[
46
]
Simon Kinberg wrote the series' first two episodes, which serve as a short story arc to introduce the show's main characters.
[
30
]
By
March
2014, the entire first season had been mapped out, and according to Greg Weisman, the series as a whole is organized as a three-act play. The first season serves as the first act of the overall series, while the second and third acts may take more than one season.
[
42
]
Star Wars Rebels
was overseen by three executive producers: Dave Filoni, Simon Kinberg, and Greg Weisman.
[
47
]
In addition to Filoni, the
Rebels
production team included several crew members returning from
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
:
Athena Yvette Portillo
as line producer,
Kilian Plunkett
as art director,
Joel Aron
as CG effects supervisor, Keith Kellogg as animation supervisor, and
Steward Lee
as episodic director. Lee, Filoni's longest-running episodic director from
The Clone Wars
, was joined in directorial duties by brother
Steven G. Lee
, a veteran of
LucasArts
.
[
27
]
Kevin Kiner
, who was previously the composer for
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
, returned as the new music composer for
Star Wars Rebels
.
[
48
]
Lucasfilm hired music producer
Flux Pavillion
to remix Kiner's
Rebels
main theme.
[
49
]
Other returning crew members from
The Clone Wars
included
Amy Beth Christenson
,
Andre Kirk
,
Pat Presley
, and
Chris Glenn
on the concept art team, managed by
Liz Cummings
, as well as
Paul Zinnes
on the development team.
[
47
]
Pablo Hidalgo
, a member of the
Lucasfilm Story Group
, also worked with the team as a fact-checker.
[
27
]
[
26
]
The crew aimed for an overall aesthetic similar to the original trilogy. As such, Joel Aron tried to give the visuals a "grainy look," Matthew Wood used many of the original trilogy's sound effects for the series' soundtrack,
[
50
]
and the crew animated the lightsabers in such a way as to emulate the look of those in the original trilogy.

Ghost
and the attack shuttle
Phantom
, included minifigures for Ezra Bridger, Zeb Orrelios, Hera Syndulla, and a placeholder for Kanan Jarrus.
[
55
]
The box originally identified Zeb's last name as "Orretios,"
[
56
]
but the finalized boxes at the New York Toy Fair not long afterward corrected the name and included Jarrus' minifigure.
[

"
We're all very dedicated, and we know this show is going to be canon, so we take that responsibility very seriously. We know that on the one hand there's an audience who's going to be watching this that knows everything there is to know about Lucasfilm canon and knows beyond that tons of stuff from the Expanded Universe, which may or may not turn out to be canon once Lucasfilm decides what is official and what's not. So we want the show to work for that group, the most extreme fanboys out there. At the same time, we also have the responsibility that for a certain generation of kids, this is going to be their first exposure to Star Wars.

Lucasfilm's Pablo Hidalgo first provided a timeline for
Star Wars Rebels
of approximately fourteen years after the events of
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Sith
, which corresponds to around five years before the events of
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
.
[
27
]
Although the official
StarWars.com
press release announcing the
Rebels
character Chopper later alternatively stated a timeline of four years prior to the events of
A New Hope
,
[
67
]
Hidalgo quickly reaffirmed the original timeframe via Twitter.
[
28
]
In reprinting portions of the original StarWars.com Chopper press release, the
Launch Pad
department from
Star Wars Insider
148
also stated a series timeline of 4 BBY.
[
98
]
Simon Kinberg told
Empire
magazine that the series would have strong connections to the overall saga: "[I've] always felt [
Star Wars Rebels
] would lead into IV and potentially set up characters you might not meet until V, or VI, or even VII, but the notion was that this would stand alone from Episode VII. That doesn't mean that we can't introduce
Easter eggs
that will pay off in VII, VIII, IX."

Dave Filoni originally claimed that Zeb Orrelios was of a new species based on Ralph McQuarrie's concept art for the Wookiee Chewbacca,
[
22
]
but a preexisting
Expanded Universe
species known as the Lasat had already been based on the concept art.
[
100
]
Star Wars Insider
148 identified Orrelios as a Lasat, though it misspelled his last name as "Orrelious."
[
98
]
Star Wars Insider
149
issued an editorial apology for the misspelling but nonetheless misspelled the character's name again, this time as "Orrilios."

The series takes place between Episodes III and IV. By this time, Order 66 has been executed and the Empire's search for the last of the Jedi Knights is in full effect. The events seen in the show take place closer to
