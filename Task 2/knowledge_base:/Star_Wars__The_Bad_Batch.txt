Official description
[
]
The series follows the elite and experimental clones of the Bad Batch (first introduced in
The Clone Wars
) as they find their way into a rapidly changing galaxy in the immediate aftermath of the Clone War. Members of Bad Batch (Clone Force 99) — a unique squad of clones who vary genetically from their brothers in the Clone Army — each possess a singular exceptional skill, which makes them extraordinarily effective soldiers and a formidable crew. In the post-Clone Wars era, they will take on daring mercenary missions as they struggle to stay afloat and find new purpose.

The Clone Wars

Star Wars: Timelines
places the events of
The Bad Batch
Season 1
in
19 BBY
.

Per the reasoning
here
,
Season 2
of
Star Wars: The Bad Batch
takes place around
18 BBY
. The tally marks made by
Omega
in
The Bad Batch
Season 3's
first episode, "
Confined
," indicate the episode must take place at least twenty-one
standard days
following her capture as depicted in the Season 2 episode "
Plan 99
." According to
"Confined" Trivia Guide | Star Wars The Bad Batch
on
StarWars.com
(

, Omega spends about 164 further days in captivity by the end of "Confined." As such, the events of Season 3 must begin around 18
BBY
