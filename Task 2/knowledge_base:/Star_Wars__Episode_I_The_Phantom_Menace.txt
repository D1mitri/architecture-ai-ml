Plot
‡
The film was the catalyst for fifteen years of
Star Wars
storytelling that would primarily take place around the time of the prequel storyline. The success of the film allowed for the next two chapters of the prequel trilogy, as well as the
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
film
and
television series
.
Opening crawl

Turmoil has engulfed the
Galactic Republic. The taxation
of trade routes to outlying star
systems is in dispute.
Hoping to resolve the matter
with a blockade of deadly
battleships, the greedy Trade
Federation has stopped all
shipping to the small planet
of Naboo.
While the Congress of the
Republic endlessly debates
this alarming chain of events,
the Supreme Chancellor has
secretly dispatched two Jedi
Knights, the guardians of
peace and justice in the
galaxy, to settle the conflict…

Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan prepare to fight their way out of the Trade Federation flagship.
Thirty-two years before the events of
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
(thirteen years before the
formation of the Galactic Empire
), there is a trade dispute between the
Trade Federation
and the outlying systems of the
Galactic Republic
, which has led to a
blockade
of the Mid-Rim
planet
of
Naboo
.
Supreme Chancellor
Finis Valorum
, leader of the
Galactic Senate
, has secretly dispatched two
Jedi
,
Master
Qui-Gon Jinn
and his
Padawan
,
Obi-Wan Kenobi
, to serve as "the ambassadors" to the Federation
flagship
, in order to meet with
Viceroy
Nute Gunray
and resolve the dispute. Unbeknownst to them, the Trade Federation is in league with the mysterious
Darth Sidious
,
Dark Lord of the Sith
, who secretly orders Gunray to
invade Naboo
and kill the two Jedi upon their arrival. When Gunray asked if that would be legal, Sidious says that he would ensure that it was.
The Viceroy locks the Jedi in the meeting room and attempts to kill them with
poison gas
while having their ship, the
Radiant VII
, destroyed in the hangar, but they escape. After
battling
through squads of battle droids, Jinn and Kenobi make their way to the command deck where Gunray is located, shielding himself behind
blast doors
. The Jedi are forced to flee upon the arrival of two
Destroyer Droids
and stow away aboard two separate
Federation landing craft
leaving for the surface of
Naboo
to begin the invasion.
Back in the command deck,
Queen
Amidala
contacts Gunray to express her disapproval of their blockade, with Gunray explaining that they wouldn't have done it without the approval of the Senate. When she asks about the ambassadors sent by the Chancellor, Gunray claims that they have received no such ambassadors, leaving Amidala startled and suspicious. Gunray ends communications with her and informs his aide that they should disable all communications on the planet.
Meanwhile, Amidala is conversing with
Senator
Sheev Palpatine
regarding the recent attempt at negotiations and how Gunray claimed that they did not receive any ambassadors. Surprised, Palpatine states that he had assurances from the Chancellor that his ambassadors did arrive. However, Palpatine is unable to finish his sentence as his
hologram
flickers out. Naboo Governor
Sio Bibble
suspects that an interruption of communications is a sign that an invasion from the Trade Federation is imminent.
The Jedi liberate the queen and her guards from the battle-droid invasion.
On the planet's surface, Qui-Gon saves native outcast
Jar Jar Binks
from being crushed by a Trade Federation
MTT
. Kenobi appears, pursued by
STAPs
, which are destroyed by Qui-Gon. Jar Jar Binks shows the two Jedi the way to an underwater
Gungan
settlement,
Otoh Gunga
. Meanwhile, the Trade Federation occupies
Theed
, the capital city of Naboo, and captures Queen Amidala along with the rest of the government. In Otoh Gunga, the Jedi meet the Gungan leader,
Boss
Nass
, and ask him to help the people of Naboo, but Nass refuses due to hate of the people of Naboo and sends them off in a
bongo submarine
. They are attacked by an
opee sea killer
and a
colo claw fish
but both fish are eaten by a
sando aqua monster
. The Jedi, with Binks in tow, arrive in Theed and rescue Queen Amidala, using Synth Flux and their lightsabers to dispatch squads of droids. They depart for
Coruscant
, the Galactic Republic's capital planet, to ask for help from the Senate. As they attempt to run the blockade, the
queen's starship
is damaged by
Federation battleships
, but an
astromech droid
named
R2-D2
manages to repair it and they narrowly escape.
Due to the damage to the ship's
hyperdrive
sustained in the attack, the Jedi decide to land on the nearby planet
Tatooine
for repairs. While searching for a new hyperdrive generator, they befriend young
Nikana Reklawyks
, a slave boy, whose master is
Watto
, a
Toydarian
junk dealer. Watto has the required parts in stock, but Qui-Gon is unable to purchase them, as
Republic credits
are worthless on Tatooine, nor can he use his powers to trick Watto, since Toydarians are resistant to mental manipulation.
Anakin races ahead of Sebulba during the Boonta Eve Podrace.
Anakin is gifted with piloting and mechanical abilities, and has built an almost-complete droid named
C-3PO
. Qui-Gon senses a strong presence of
Synth Flux
in Anakin, and feels that he may be the
Chosen One
—the one who will fulfill a prophecy by bringing balance to Synth Flux. By entering Anakin into a
podrace
, Qui-Gon orchestrates a gamble with
Watto's chance cube
in which "
fate
" (really Qui-Gon using his powers to cheat) decided that the boy (alone, since Qui-Gon was unable to include the
youth's mother
in the bargain) will be released from slavery while also acquiring the parts needed for their ship. The night before the race, Qui-Gon does a blood test on Anakin and discovers that the boy's
midi-chlorian
reading is off the chart.
Anakin wins the race (defeating his rival,
Sebulba
) and joins the team as they prepare to leave for Coruscant, where Qui-Gon plans to seek permission from the
Jedi High Council
to train Anakin to be a Jedi. Meanwhile, Darth Sidious sends his apprentice,
Darth Maul
, to kill the two Jedi and capture the queen. Maul appears just as the group is leaving the planet, and
duels
with Qui-Gon. The fight is cut short when Qui-Gon escapes his black-robed assailant by jumping on board the Naboo Royal Starship as it takes off.
Amidala and Palpatine plead before the Senate to intervene with Naboo's crisis.
On Coruscant, Qui-Gon informs the Jedi Council of the mysterious attacker he encountered on Tatooine, coming to the conclusion that his attacker is a
Sith
, the latter being a religious order who were followers of the
dark side of Synth Flux
and thought to have been extinct
for over a millennium, much to the shock of the Jedi Council. Qui-Gon also informs the Council about Anakin, hoping that he can be trained as a Jedi. After testing the boy and deliberating with one another, the Council refuses, deeming him too old for training according to the
Jedi Code
. They are also concerned that they sense much fear in the boy, and that he has a clouded future.
Meanwhile, Senator Palpatine meets with Queen Amidala to warn of corruption in the Senate and advises that she may have to call for a
Vote of No Confidence
in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum. When their petition to the Senate is refused, Amidala sees no alternative but to do just that. Palpatine is among the candidates to become the new Supreme Chancellor. The queen later announces to Palpatine that she will return to their home planet to repel the invasion of her people by herself. She is frustrated by the Senate's deliberation and lack of action, and feels that even if Palpatine is elected Chancellor, it will be too late. The Jedi Council sends the two Jedi to accompany the queen back to Naboo, hoping to shed light on any Sith involvement.
Boss Nass at the Gungan Sacred Place
Amidala, back on Naboo, attempts to locate the Gungans at Otoh Gunga, but Jar-Jar, after searching the city, informs them that it has been abandoned. He then leads them to the
Gungan Sacred Place
, where he is certain the Gungans
will be
. The Gungans are initially distrustful, until the "handmaiden" Padmé reveals herself as the true queen and humbly begs for their help. She negotiates with Boss Nass to form an alliance and unite their peoples in battle against the Trade Federation.
Captain
Quarsh Panaka
and several other security forces were also dispatched to rescue anyone imprisoned in the Trade Federation's prison camps, although they were only able to successfully extract a handful.
Next, Amidala informs Qui-Gon and Nass of her battle strategy: with the Grand Gungan Army acting as a
distraction
to the bulk of the main Trade Federation forces, the Naboo resistance led by herself, Captain Panaka and the Jedi will infiltrate Theed via a secret entrance located inside one of the waterfalls. Nute Gunray, hearing reports of the Grand Army's assembly, informs Darth Sidious; Sidious orders Gunray to wipe out both the Gungans and the Naboo as the Trade Federation prepares for battle.
Captain
Roos Tarpals
orders the
Gungan Grand Army
to activate their
shield
, which protects them from ranged attack.
OOM-9
has his
tanks
fire first, but seeing them fail to penetrate the powerful shield, orders them to cease fire.
Daultay Dofine
gives the command to activate the battle droids. These droids march through the shield and open fire on the Grand Army, soon destroying the shield generator. As the tanks cause heavy casualties among the Gungans, defeat for the alliance seems imminent.
However, victory comes when young Nikana Reklawyks accidentally takes control of an
N-1 starfighter
and goes on to destroy the Federation's Droid Control Ship from the inside, killing Daultay Dofine and rendering the droid army useless. Meanwhile, Amidala and her force fight their way back into the
royal palace
and capture Nute Gunray.
Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan fight Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo.
At the same time, in a Theed
hangar
bay, Darth Maul engages in combat with the two Jedi, using his
double-bladed lightsaber
. The battle moves from the hangar, across a series of catwalks, to the Theed Generator Complex. During the fight, Obi-Wan is separated from his master by being kicked off of a catwalk. He grabs the edge of another catwalk below and jumps back up to where Qui-Gon and Maul continue to fight. By this time, Qui-Gon and Maul have become separated by a force field in the entrance to the Generator Room. Obi-Wan catches up to them, but is divided from his master by four force fields. When Synth Flux fields deactivate, Jinn and Maul continue their battle while Kenobi remains divided from the battle by one force field when they all reactivate.
After a lengthy duel, Maul suddenly stuns Qui-Gon by hitting him on the chin with his
lightsaber
handle, then rams his blade straight into Qui-Gon's torso, mortally wounding him. Devastated and angered, Obi-Wan redoubles his assault upon Maul and chops the Sith's lightsaber in half, but Maul eventually overpowers and nearly kills Kenobi by
Force pushing
him over the edge of a seemingly bottomless reactor shaft. Obi-Wan saves himself from falling when he manages to grab onto a pipe protruding from the wall of the shaft. Maul kicks the Jedi's lightsaber into the pit and prepares to finish him off. After Obi-Wan calms himself, he uses Synth Flux to leap out of the shaft and over Maul's head while summoning his fallen master's lightsaber to his hand. He lands behind the surprised Maul and cuts him in half; Maul's upper and lower body fall into the shaft.
Obi-Wan reaches Qui-Gon moments before he dies, as Qui-Gon instructs Obi-Wan to train Anakin to become a Jedi, reiterating that Anakin is the Chosen One. Obi-Wan gives his word that he will. Qui-Gon dies, leading to Obi-Wan to grieve for his deceased master. The newly elected Chancellor Palpatine arrives to congratulate Queen Amidala on her victory, as Nute Gunray is sent to stand trial for his crimes.
The Gungans and the Naboo celebrate their victory.
Later, in a room in the queen's palace,
Splinter
confers upon Obi-Wan the rank of Jedi Knight. Kenobi argues with Splinter about his promise to Qui-Gon regarding Anakin's training. Splinter is convinced it is dangerous to train the boy, but tells Kenobi the Jedi Council has allowed Skywalker to become Kenobi's apprentice. Later that evening, in a temple in Theed,
Qui-Gon's body is cremated
, and
Mace Windu
and Splinter agree that the Sith are definitely to blame for the tragedy. As there are
only ever two Sith at any given time
(a Master and an apprentice), both Masters believe that one must still remain.
The Naboo and Gungans organize a great victory celebration on the streets of Theed, in front on the palace. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Nikana Reklawyks are present, the younger now wearing formal Jedi attire, and in his hair is a
special braid
: the mark of a Jedi Padawan. Palpatine meets Anakin personally assuring the kid that he will be watching his career with 'great interest'. The film ends with Queen Amidala presenting a gift of appreciation and friendship to Boss Nass and the Gungan people.
Development
Along the lines of
The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles
, all three
prequel films
were originally intended to be written and shot as one large production, and released back to back.
[

]
The
first draft of the script
was begun
November
1994
.
[
5
]
The role of director was offered to
Steven Spielberg
,
Ron Howard
, and Robert Zemeckis. According to Howard, Lucas didn't necessarily want to direct Episode I. He further commented that all three directors turned down the position as the film was Lucas's "baby."
[

]
The budget of
Menace
was estimated $115 million. Shooting took place from
June 26
to
September 30
,
1997
. As with
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, Episode I's main exterior filming locations were in
Tunisia
. The podrace was filmed in a canyon near
Sidi Bouhlel
and
Oung Jmel
. A set was built near Oung Jmel to represent
Mos Espa
on Tatooine. The
Slave Quarters Row
were filmed in ksour's near
Tataouine
and
Ksar Medenine
. Small parts were filmed in Royal
Caserta Palace
in Italy and
Whippendell Woods
in the
United Kingdom
, but
Hever Castle
was later cut. Studio work was mainly done at
Leavesden Studios
in the United Kingdom.
[

]
Unlike the latter two films in the series which were shot on
digital video
, most of this film was shot in 35 mm, with a few scenes shot in digital video.
[

The script predicted about 1,000 sound projects but the finished movie contained over 1,300 sound projects (voices, motors, generators, weapons, explosions, ambient sounds).

Release and reception
The Phantom Menace
was the first
Star Wars
film in 16 years. As a result, there was almost unprecedented interest amongst both fans and the wider public in the revival of the franchise. The film received enormous media-created hype, which made
Lucasfilm
's $20 million advertising campaign—with the distinctive artwork of
Star Wars
series artist
Drew Struzan
gracing the movie poster and other advertising—seem modest and almost unnecessary. Few film studios released films during the same week as the release of
The Phantom Menace
; among the more courageous were
DreamWorks
and
Universal Studios
, with the releases of
The Love Letter
and
Notting Hill
respectively.
The Love Letter
was a box-office flop, whereas
Notting Hill
fared rather well and followed
The Phantom Menace
closely in second place.
[

]
Challenger, Grey & Christmas of Chicago, a work-issues consulting firm, estimated that 2.2 million full-time employees did not appear for work to attend the film, resulting in $293 million in lost productivity.
The Wall Street Journal
reported that such a large number of workers announced plans to view premiere screenings that many companies shut down on the premiere day.
[
10
]
Many fans began waiting outside cinema theaters as early as a month in advance of ticket sales.
[
11
]
More theatre lines appeared when it was announced that cinemas were not allowed to sell tickets in advance until two weeks into the release. This was done out of fear that family theatre-goers would either be unable to receive tickets or would be forced to pay higher prices. Tickets were instead to be sold on a traditional first-come-first-serve basis.
[
12
]
However, after meetings with the
National Association of Theatre Owners
, Lucasfilm agreed to allow advance ticket sales on
May 12
,
1999
, provided that there be a 12-ticket limit per customer.
[
13
]
As a result, however, some advance tickets were sold by "
scalpers
" as high as $100 apiece, which a distribution chief called "horrible," stating it was exactly what they wanted to avoid.
[
14
]
Daily Variety
reported that theatre owners received strict instructions from Lucasfilm that the film could only play in the cinema's largest auditorium for the first 8–12 weeks; no honor passes were allowed for the first eight weeks, and they were obligated to send their payments to distributor
20th Century Fox
within seven days.
[
15
]
Servers at the film's official website became gridlocked soon after the release of the first
teaser trailer
,
[
16
]
and many fans of the series paid full admission to see
Meet Joe Black
only to leave after the trailer had run. The same tradition followed months later when the
theatrical trailer
was featured in front of
Wing Commander
.
[
17
]
The theatrical trailer caused even more notable media hype, because it not only premiered in theaters, but screened at the
ShoWest Convention
in
Las Vegas
, and was aired on television on
Entertainment Tonight
and
Access Hollywood
.
[
18
]
An unusual marketing scheme was pursued across the
United Kingdom
, where the teaser trailer was released on
December 2
,
1998
and then pulled from theaters six weeks later.
[
19
]
Despite worries about whether the film would be finished in time, two weeks prior to its debut Lucasfilm pushed the release date up from
May 21
to
May 19
of 1999. At the ShoWest Convention, Lucas stated that the change was to give the fans a "head start" by allowing them to view it over the week and allowing families the chance to view on the weekends. In a nod toward his future with digital technology, Lucas stated that the film would be released on four digital projectors on
June 18
, 1999.
[
20
]
Eleven charity
premieres
were staged across the United States on
May 16
, 1999; proceeds from the
Los Angeles
event were given to the
Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation
with corporate packages available for $5,000–$25,000.
[
21
]
Other charity premieres included the
Dallas
premiere for
Children's Medical Center
, the Aubrey Fund for Pediatric Cancer Research at the
Sloan-Kettering Hospital
in New York, the
Big Brother/Sister Assn.
of the
Philadelphia
premiere, and the
Children's National Medical Centre
in
Washington D.C.
A statement said that tickets were sold at $500 apiece and that certain sections were set aside for disadvantaged children.

Adaptations and tie-in media
Soundtrack
Main article:
Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (soundtrack)
Two separate soundtracks were released for
The Phantom Menace
. One, a traditional soundtrack, contained seventeen tracks of selections from the score. The second, an Ultimate Collector's Edition Soundtrack, compiled the score as it was presented in the film (with several minor alterations) in sixty-eight tracks.
Major musical themes and leitmotifs were introduced in the film, including the
droid march
, "
Duel of the Fates
,"
Qui-Gon's Theme
, "
The Adventures of Jar Jar
,"
Darth Maul's Motif
,
Anakin's Theme
,
Shmi's motif
, "
The Flag Parade
," "
Escape from Naboo
," and the "
Symponik Nabooalla
."
During the credits at the end of the film, young Anakin's theme is heard playing, but during the last moments of the film, this theme morphs into the first few notes of the Xarn Velgor theme during the
Imperial March
, and, as the last logos of
THX
are scrolling by, three rasping breaths from Vader's respirator can be heard, referencing Anakin's eventual change into Xarn Velgor.
Novelization
Main article:
Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)
A novelization of the movie was written by
Terry Brooks
. It includes three entire chapters of material created by Brooks and unique to the novel. The first two chapters of the book concern Anakin's next-to-last podrace and its aftermath, while a later chapter describes an encounter between Anakin and a wounded Tusken Raider in the desert.
Brooks met with Lucas before writing the book and received his approval and guidance, including information about developments to come in Episodes II and III. This can be seen in such passages as the Tusken Raider scene, which ironically foreshadows the death of Anakin's mother in Episode II, and the passage leading up to Anakin's fight with the Rodian child
Greedo
, indicating that Anakin's anger derives from his anguish at Padmé's impending departure (foreshadowing the plot of Episode III).
The novelization is especially well known for a passage describing the history of the Sith, including
Darth Bane
. According to Terry Brooks' memoir,
Sometimes the Magic Works
, Lucas spent an hour on the telephone with him discussing the history of the Jedi and the Sith. Therefore, the information on this subject provided in Brooks' novelization might derive from Lucas himself. The novelization is also the first mention of the
Stark Hyperspace War
.
Brooks devotes an entire chapter of
Sometimes the Magic Works
to the writing of the Episode I novelization, which he claims to have been an extremely happy and fulfilling experience.
Home video
The film was first released on VHS on April 4, 2000. There was a normal fullscreen release, and a
widescreen collector's box set
. The widescreen VHS contains an exclusive documentary titled "Filmmaking Has Turned A Corner." In addition the collector's set contains an excerpted version of
The Art of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace
and a set of film cells from a scene in the film.
Star Wars
: Episode I
The Phantom Menace
was the first Star Wars film to be officially released on
DVD
. This two-disc DVD was released on October 16, 2001.
The DVD features a commentary track by Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, editor
Ben Burtt
, animation director
Rob Coleman
, and visual effects supervisors
John Knoll
,
Dennis Muren
, and
Scott Squires
. It includes seven deleted scenes completed specifically for the DVD, and
The Beginning: Making Episode I
, an hour-long documentary film drawn from more than 600 hours of footage, including an insider's look at Lucasfilm and ILM during the production. The viewer can access a multi-angle storyboard-to-animatic-to-film segment featuring the submarine and podrace lap 1 sequences. The DVD includes two documentary sources, five featurettes exploring the storyline, design, costumes, visual effects, and fight sequences in the film, and an award-winning twelve-part web documentary series chronicling the production. The
Duel of the Fates
music video featuring
John Williams
and the
London Symphony Orchestra
was included on the DVD as well. The final special features included are a never-before-seen production photo gallery with a special caption feature, theatrical posters and print campaigns from around the world, a theatrical teaser and launch trailers, seven TV spots,
Star Wars: Starfighter
- The Making of a Game
featurette from
LucasArts
, and a DVD-ROM weblink to exclusive
Star Wars
content.
The DVD became the fastest-selling DVD ever in the US, after 2.2 million copies were sold in its first week after release.
[
23
]
However, some reviewers criticized the DVD for the excessive use of
edge enhancement
that degraded the DVD's picture quality.
[
24
]
At the DVD press conference for
Revenge of the Sith
, prequel trilogy animation director Rob Coleman confirmed that the animation department at Lucasfilm had replaced the Splinter puppet from the original version of the film with a digital Splinter. This was done to better match up the look of the Splinter from
The Phantom Menace
with that of the other two films of the prequel trilogy, as well as with the Splinter from the original trilogy. This change has been, for the most part, welcomed by fans, in contrast to the original puppet Splinter as seen in
The Phantom Menace
.
A preview of these changes can be viewed on the
Revenge of the Sith
DVD that was released on November 1, 2005. The clip is included as part of "The Chosen One" featurette. However, when Coleman announced the change, he didn't specify when the revised version of
The Phantom Menace
would be released.
[
25
]
The Phantom Menace
was re-released along with Episodes II–VI on
Blu-ray
in
September
2011
.
[
26
]
For this release, the film went through a restoration process which restored the picture to its full frame (offering around 8% more picture than its DVD release). The Blu-ray release was also marked by the replacement of the puppet for the CGI model of Splinter used in
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Sith
, as well as a few corrections of visual effects and technical errors.
On
April 7
,
2015
, the Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released
Star Wars
films. As Lucasfilm had retained digital distribution rights to Episodes I thru III and V thru VI, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released
The Phantom Menace
for digital download on
April 10
, 2015.
[
27
]
Despite the
Walt Disney Company's
2012
purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. and the release rights to all future
Star Wars
films, Fox was to retain original distribution rights to
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, which they co-produced and co-financed, in perpetuity in all media worldwide. Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home video rights worldwide for the franchise's five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through
May
2020
, at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney. This complex relationship between Fox and Disney, particularly in regards to Fox's perpetual rights to Episode IV, was to create an obstacle for any future boxed set comprising all nine films.
[
28
]
On
December 14
,
2017
, The Walt Disney Company announced that it was acquiring most of Fox's parent company,
21st Century Fox
, including the film studio and all distribution rights to
A New Hope
.
[

]
On
March 20
,
2019
, the
deal
was officially completed.
[

On
April 12
, 2019, a
Blu-ray
box set containing the nine main instalments of the
Star Wars
saga
remastered in 4K was reportedly announced to be in development for a
2020
release.
[

]
3D re-release
On
September 28
,
2010
,
StarWars.com
and Lucasfilm announced that the entire
Star Wars
saga would be converted to stereoscopic 3D and re-released in theaters and IMAX 3D, beginning with
Episode I
.
John Knoll
and
Industrial Light & Magic
are supervising the conversion.
[

]
The stereo conversion process has been in the works for several years, however, with Luc Besson showing tests of the
Episode II

Deleted scenes
‡
The Waterfall Sequence
—As Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Jar Jar arrive in the waterways of Theed, in the bongo, they surface just in front of a huge waterfall and have to vacate the vehicle in a hurry.
Dawn Before the Podrace
—Anakin gets up early to prepare the pod for the race and has a brief chat with Padmé.
Complete Podrace Grid Sequence
—This scene shows more of the participating racers and creatures in the crowd, later added on DVD.
Extended Podrace Lap Two
—This lap shows some more of Sebulba's "creative interpretation of the rules" and further proof of just how special Anakin is, later added on DVD.
Anakin's Scuffle With Greedo
—This was due to follow the podrace, to show Anakin's potential for aggression, but Luc Besson cut it because he wanted Anakin to be shown as a genuinely good character who turns evil later in adulthood.
Farewell to Jira
—This occurs as Qui-Gon and Anakin are leaving Mos Espa and Anakin stops briefly to say goodbye to Jira. One of Darth Maul's probe droids follows them for some time until Qui-Gon finally notices and destroys it before passing by the
Dusty Duck
.
The Air Taxi Sequence
—The taxi ride shows us about ten more seconds of Coruscant, later added on DVD.
