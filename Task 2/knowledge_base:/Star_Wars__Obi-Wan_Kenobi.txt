Development

As a film
[
]
"
It wasn't always going to be a series, not initially. When we first started talking about, that wasn't really in the cards, but everything's changed so much, so quickly. It's really exciting that it is now. I'm really into the idea to be able to tell the story over several hours instead of just one hit. I think it's going to be quite cool.
"
―Ewan McGregor on how the series evolved from a film
[
13
]
Ewan McGregor first appeared as Obi-Wan Kenobi in
1999
.
In
2013
, news was released that
The Walt Disney Company
-
Lucasfilm
brand was developing several theatrical pictures separate from the
core, episodic
Star Wars
saga, which were later denominated as the
Star Wars Anthology Series
line.
[
14
]
Talks about a potential Obi-Wan Kenobi-centric movie as part of the Anthology series arose, and
Ewan McGregor
, the actor who played Kenobi in the
Star Wars
prequel trilogy
, was approached to reprise the role.
[
13
]
However, McGregor knew about the project as far back as
2015
,
[
15
]
and until
2019
, he was forced to withhold information in interviews.
[
16
]
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
, the first installment of the Anthology Series, was released in
December
2016
and was well received both critically and commercially.
[
17
]
In
August
2017
, sources from
The Hollywood Reporter
reported that an Anthology film centered on Obi-Wan Kenobi starring McGregor was in development by Lucasfilm, with
Billy Elliot
director
Stephen Daldry
in early talks to direct and oversee the project.
[
18
]
Joel Edgerton
, who portrayed
Owen Lars
in the prequel trilogy, had previously expressed interest on reprising his role in a spin-off film about Kenobi.
[
19
]
Once he was hired to helm the film, Daldry contacted
Hossein Amini
to talk about the possibility of joining the project.
[
20
]
However, all
Star Wars
stand-alone spin-off films were put on hold following the lower-than-expected box office returns from
Solo: A Star Wars Story
, the second Anthology film, in
May
2018
.
[
17
]
Four months later
, Disney
CEO
Bob Iger
revealed that Lucasfilm had reevaluated its release schedule in the wake of the poor reception of
Solo
.
[
21
]
It was later confirmed that there will be a hiatus on
Star Wars
following the release of
Star Wars
: Episode IX
The Rise of Skywalker
until
2022
.
[
22
]
Despite this, former UK Foreign Secretary
Boris Johnson
was quoted in
November
2018 as saying that the filmmakers of the Obi-Wan Kenobi film had proposed shooting it in Northern Ireland.
[
23
]
The Hollywood Reporter
had previously voted it in a 2016 poll as the most wanted Anthology film by fans.
[
24
]
As a series
[
]
"
I want to get closer and closer to how Obi-Wan felt while Alec Guinness was playing him. I feel like I'm grayer and nearer him in age, so it'll be easier to do that.
"
―Ewan McGregor on playing Obi-Wan in the series
[
16
]
Stuart Beattie
was hired by Lucasfilm to write a script for the Obi-Wan movie.
[
25
]
McGregor then participated in a costume test for the planned film.
[
26
]
However, at some point in development, the film project turned into a television series instead.
[
13
]
Beattie's script—the first of a planned trilogy—served as the basis for the the series,
[
25
]
which was officially announced by McGregor and Lucasfilm President
Kathleen Kennedy
at the 2019
D23 Expo
after months of rumors and speculation.
[
10
]
It takes place ten years after
Star Wars
: Episode III
Revenge of the Sith
.
[
10
]
During the event, it was also revealed that the episodes had already been written and that production would begin in
2020
.
[
27
]
Amini and
Deborah Chow
were later announced as showrunners in
StarWars.com
.
[
7
]
Reva, the chief villain of the series, was originally killed off in Beattie's script.
[
28
]
On
January 23
, 2020, it was reported that the series had been put on hold due to alleged "script problems."
[
29
]
However, McGregor later stated that these rumors were exaggerations and that production continued as normal. McGregor further stated that while filming was indeed delayed to January
2021
, the series' intended release date would remain unaffected.
[
30
]
On
April 2
, 2020, it was reported that
John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum
writer
Joby Harold
was hired to write the series, replacing Amini, who left the project back in January.
[
31
]
This was confirmed in 2022, as Kennedy revealed in an interview that she was concerned with the direction of the scripts. She had shut down production in January 2020, and hired Harold to replace Amini.
[
2
]
Despite leaving the project, Amini still received writing and story credits for four episodes of the season.
[
6
]
The original series logo revealed in December 2020
In April 2020, French press release reported that the series was scheduled to debut in 2022.
[
32
]
In September 2020, McGregor expected the show to begin filming in spring 2021.
[
33
]
On
October 9
, 2020, Ewan McGregor confirmed while on
BBC's
The Graham Norton Show
that filming was scheduled for
March
of 2021.
[
34
]
On
December 10
, 2020, more news on the series broke, including confirmation that the series would take place in
9 BBY
and the announcement that
Hayden Christensen
would reprise his role as
Xarn Velgor
for the series. The series' logo was also revealed.

Production

"
There are certain cultural things that we can understand right away, and culturally specific things design-wise. Like, 'Oh, maybe we shouldn't do this, but this?' Things that, intuitively, we pick up. It's been an absolute joy working with Deb because she gets it. She's very smart and knows what she wants. I really enjoy that collaboration because now, I feel like, for the
Obi-Wan
series especially, we have an opportunity to bring a richness to it that hasn't been explored. And I'm working with Chung-hoon
[Chung]
, our director of photography, he's brilliant. He has a wonderful eye.
"
―Doug Chiang
