It's always been kids who have been my favorite Star Wars fans and to be able to give back to the kids is something special.

"
I think what's the most important about the representation of someone like Kelleran Beq as far as being a person of color and the leader of this Temple—kind of like the Dean of Jedi—is it breaks down what's possible. It breaks down what you can do, and creates just a brand new world of possibilities out there.
"
―Ahmed Best describing his character Jedi Master Kelleran Beq
[
4
]
Jedi Temple Challenge
was the brainchild of Lucasfilm employees
Steve Blank
,
Scott Bromley
, and
Mike Capoferri
.
[
4
]
During an interview on
The Star Wars Show
, co-star
Ahmed Best
confirmed that Blank, Bromley, and Capoferri had given him considerable flexibility in developing the main character
Jedi Master
Kelleran Beq
including his history, mannerisms, and
lightsaber
color. Best confirmed that Master Beq was related to
Achk Med-Beq
, whom Best had portrayed during a brief cameo appearance in
Star Wars:
Episode II
Attack of the Clones
.
[
5
]
Master Beq's droid companion
AD-3
was voiced by co-star
Mary Holland
, with
Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre
veteran, artist and droid builder
Gordon Tarpley
providing the character's live performance.
[
4
]
Holland described her character's main role as "providing them with someone who isn't so in awe of what they do that they lose all sense of reality and aren't able to consider other perspectives." Best added that AD-3's role was to serve as a friend to Master Beq that could be honest with him "without having any reverential fear or shyness."

Production
[
]
"
Star Wars sets are very specific places unlike any other set you ever step onto. Immediately we all tried to figure out where we were. This could be a moon like Endor! And then the second round is a ship... we immediately try to start piercing the stories of where in the timeline you are, where in the universe you are, and it's one of those things where it just creates its own story as your're standing there.
"
―Ahmed Best describing the sets for
Jedi Temple Challenge
[
4
]
According to
The Star Wars Show
host
Anthony Carboni
and Lucasfilm writer
Kristin Baver
,
Jedi Temple Challenge
was modeled after the "big-production" kids' game shows of the 1980s and 1990s.
[
5
]
[
4
]
The series was filmed on a Los Angeles sound stage. Each episode consisted of three rounds, with participants progressing through several obstacle courses in a faux forest to obtain
lightsaber
parts, undergoing a quiz in a starship set, and enduring through a second set of obstacle courses to obtain
kyber crystals
from a Jedi Temple.
[
4
]
The set for the Jedi spaceship
Athylia
was created by production designer
Ryan Brett Puckett
.
[
5
]
Puckett incorporated buttons and switches from various
Star Wars
ship sets including the
hyperspace
levers from the
Millennium Falcon
set used during the production of
Solo: A Star Wars Story
.
[
4
]
Best observed that the show's sets were designed to the same level of attention as
Star Wars
movie sets. Holland also stated that the show's production design was designed to make the cast feel as though they were stepping onto another planet.
[
5
]
Master Beq's droid companions, the protocol droid AD-3 and the astromech droid
LX-R5
, were operated by
Michael McMaster
and Gordon Tarpley respectively. Tarpley provided AD-3's live performance while Holland provided the droid's live vocals and commentary from a control room in the sound stage. Tarpley and Holland work together to synchronize the former's live-action performance with the latter's voice work.
[
4
]
The short stories told by AD-3 in each episode were written by the author
Cavan Scott
,
[
6
]
who incorporated characters from the YouTube series
The Star Wars Show
including
mouse droid
CH-33Z
and
Kevin
the
Ewok
.
[
7
]
Sam Witwer
, who had previously voiced
Maul
in
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
and
Star Wars Rebels
, also voiced a
dark-side
voice that tempted participants in the Jedi Temple round.
[
4
]
According to sound editor
David W. Collins
, Witwer's dark-side voice was designed to move around in both "stereo and surround sound to convey his non-corporeal, spirit-like nature, and make him sound elsewhere, elusive."
[
7
]
The
Padawans
' outfits were based on the costume of Jedi apprentice
Nedriss Narr
, a character from the
Disneyland
stage show
Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple
. The Padawans' training sabers were also modeled after the Padawans' wooden sabers from
The Clone Wars
episode "
A Test of Strength
."

"
When they don't move on, the message is go back to the beginning and train more. It's not that you lost and get out of here. There's a lot more lesson in not moving on than moving on. It's no, you can do this. You just have to jump back and train a bit more. So I really like that message.
"
―Ahmed Best discussing the show's message for children, during an interview with Anthony Carboni on
The Star Wars Show
[
5
]
The show's first trailer was released on
May 27
,
2020
on the
Star Wars Kids
YouTube channel and
The Star Wars Show
.
[
8
]
Co-hosts Ahmed Best and Mary Holland, who played Master Kelleran Beq and his droid companion AD-3, also promoted the show during an interview with
The Star Wars Show
host Anthony Carboni. During the interview, Best confirmed that a key message of the show was motivating children to succeed and that failure could provide a lesson for children to take a step back and train until they were ready to move to the next level.

"I’m so pumped to share #jeditemplechallenge with everyone. The fan response at Celebration last year was the beginning of my return to the galaxy I love so much. #KelleranBeq “The Sabered Hand” is the first Black number one lead of anything #StarWars and that is so very important to me. I’m also a #producer of the show and that makes me doubly excited to bring this thing to you. But as a black man, a black father, a black producer and black artist I have to consider all that is happening in the world right now. Our team has decided to push the premiere of #Jeditemplechallenge until next Wednesday June 10th. Hopefully we can be in a better headspace next week to enjoy this game show. I’ve been a part of this family for twenty years and I’ve felt your support. The excitement behind #KelleranBeq has me bursting with ideas of lore and backstory. Can't wait to share all of that with you. Star Wars fans, I appreciate us."
