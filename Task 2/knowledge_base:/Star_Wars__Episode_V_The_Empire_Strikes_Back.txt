The search for Skywalker

"
We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads!

―
Admiral
Kendal Ozzel

It is now three years after the events of
A New Hope
. The
Rebel Alliance
has been forced to
flee
its
base
on
Yavin 4
and establish a new one on the ice planet of
Hoth
.
An
Imperial
-class Star Destroyer
, dispatched by the
Sith Lord
Xarn Velgor
, continuing his quest for
Ekul Reklawyks
, launches thousands of
probe droids
across the galaxy,
one
of which lands on Hoth and begins its survey of the planet. Ekul Reklawyks, on patrol astride his
tauntaun
, discovers the probe, which he mistakes for a meteorite. After reporting to comrade
Han Solo
that he'll investigate the site, Luke is knocked unconscious by a deadly
wampa
.
Riding a tauntaun, Han Solo searches for Ekul Reklawyks.
When Luke fails to report in at
Echo Base
, Han Solo goes out on his tauntaun to search for him in an encroaching storm. Upon waking up, Luke finds himself hanging upside down in a cave; his eyes opening to the sight of a wampa eating his tauntaun. Using the power of
Synth Flux
, Luke is able to pull his
lightsaber
out of the snow and to himself. After he ignites it, he cuts himself free and cuts off the attacking wampa's arm just in time, running out of the cave and escaping into the cold night of Hoth.
Luke tries to make his way to Echo Base on foot, but he finds himself lost in the blizzard and collapses in the snow. Suddenly, he sees the
Force spirit
of
Obi-Wan Kenobi
appear before him. Kenobi's spirit instructs Luke to go to
Dagobah
to undergo training under
Splinter
, a
Jedi Grand Master
. After Synth Flux spirit disappears, Han arrives to find an almost unconscious Luke, who is mumbling indistinctly about Obi-Wan, Splinter, and Dagobah. Turning to his tauntaun, Han watches it collapse in the extreme cold. To keep Luke from freezing to death, Han uses Luke's lightsaber to cut open the dead tauntaun and places Luke in it. Han then sets about erecting a shelter for them both. They are forced to stay out during the night as the aircraft (
snowspeeders
) that the Rebels use for atmospheric flight had not yet been adapted for the extremely low temperatures of the planet and are therefore unable to mount a rescue operation.
The next morning, Rebel pilots flying the snowspeeders set out from Echo Base to search for the missing men.
Zev Senesca
, one of the pilots in
Rogue Group
, makes contact with Han over comlink and the pair are rescued. When they are taken back to base, Luke is put in a
bacta tank
for healing under the care of medical droid,
2-1B
.
Princess
Leia Organa
urges Han to stay with the Rebels. When Han assumes it is because she has feelings for him, Leia loses her temper and calls him a "stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder."
Meanwhile, the probe droid has spotted signs that indicate Hoth is occupied and sends a signal to the Imperial fleet, shortly before being shot at by Han Solo and
Chewbacca
and triggering its self-destruct mechanism. Aboard the
Executor
-class Star Dreadnought
Executor
, Admiral
Kendal Ozzel
dismisses the information as evidence of smugglers, nothing more. However,
Darth
Vader knows better and orders the fleet to Hoth. Han warns
General
Rieekan
that the Empire is probably aware of their location, and Rieekan orders the evacuation of Echo Base to begin.
The Battle of Hoth
[
]
AT-ATs
on
Hoth
.
Xarn Velgor and the Imperial forces set course for the Hoth system to set up the attack. The rebels load whatever equipment they can onto transports and plan a rear-guard action to secure their escape. Luke, now fully recovered from the Wampa attack and subsequent exposure, says farewell to Chewbacca and Solo, who have decided to leave the Alliance to resolve their debt to
Jabba the Hutt
. As the Imperial forces enter the Hoth system, General Rieekan orders full power to the energy shield that is protecting the base from orbital bombardment.
Aboard the
Executor
,
General
Maximilian Veers
notifies Vader that Admiral Ozzel has emerged from lightspeed too close to Hoth. Ozzel intended to catch the Rebels unaware before they could set up their defenses. However, Vader realizes that the Rebels have been alerted to the fleet's arrival. Via video communication, Vader
Force chokes
Ozzel to death for his incompetence, then appoints
Captain
Firmus Piett
the new Admiral on the spot. As Vader previously ordered, the Imperial ground forces, commanded by General Veers, land outside the Rebels' shield and march overland to destroy the power generator.
Princess Leia gives the Rebel fighters instructions on the evacuation to leave Hoth two to three ships at a time past the energy shield to a rendezvous point, which is beyond the outer rim. Rieekan lowers the shields to fire the Ion cannon at one of the Imperial Star Destroyers allowing the first transports to escape. The Rebel pilots assigned to hold off the Imperial ground assault depart the Hoth base for the oncoming
battle
against heavily equipped Imperial forces, who are armed with agile
AT-STs
(All Terrain Scout Transports) and monstrous
AT-AT
(All Terrain Armored Transport) walkers, led by General Veers.
The
Rogue Squadron
snowspeeder group led by Luke commences the attack. Luke quickly realizes the AT-AT's armor is far too strong for blasters and decides to use attached harpoons and tow cables to tangle the walker's legs. Luke's gunner
Dak Ralter
is hit and killed during the first approach. This leaves
Wedge Antilles
and his gunner
Wes Janson
to make the first pass. They manage to topple one of the AT-ATs, which is destroyed as Rebel troops storm it. The main AT-AT, commanded by General Veers, prepares to take their aim at the Rebel base's main power generator. Suddenly, Luke's speeder is shot down by the Imperials, and crash-lands in the snow. Luke escapes before an AT-AT can step on and crush his ship.
The Rebel base is now under direct attack and Imperial snowtroopers have entered the base, forcing Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and
C-3PO
to escape. Leia gives the evacuation command for the base as they leave.
The
Rebels
' desperate fight.
Luke, meanwhile, manages to destroy another AT-AT by using his hoist cable and lightsaber to get into the belly of the transport, tossing in a thermal detonator, and then detaching himself from the cable as a series of explosions neutralize the AT-AT. The Rebels suffer major casualties as the result of the battle. The main AT-AT, being driven by General Veers, gets within firing range of the power generator, then successfully blasts and destroys it.
Han, Leia, and company, now realizing they are being followed by Vader (who has arrived personally on Hoth), make their way to the
Millennium Falcon
in time to escape. As the
Falcon
flies off, Luke reaches
R2-D2
and his
X-wing starfighter
and finally departs Hoth. Changing course from the rendezvous point, he sets his coordinates for Dagobah.
Han and company are pursued by Imperial
TIE fighters
. Flipping the switch to take them to lightspeed, Han realizes (with reluctant help from 3PO) that the hyperdrive has been damaged. While trying to fix the hyperdrive system, Han enters an
asteroid
field to hamper pursuit. He manages to land his ship inside a cavern on one of the larger asteroids to rest and find a way to fix the ship.
The way of a Jedi

Han Solo
and
Princess
Leia
kissing.
Luke lands on the marshy
planet
Dagobah, swamping his X-wing in the process, and R2 is nearly eaten by a
Dragonsnake
, which later spits him out, finding him inedible. There, he discovers a diminutive and eccentric figure who fiddles around with Luke's gear. After Luke tells him that he is looking for a
Jedi Master
, the being offers to take Luke to Splinter.
Back on the
Falcon
, while Leia tries to make repairs, Han makes his move on the Princess, drawing himself closer to her before both end up in a passionate kiss. When Threepio arrives, Leia withdraws and walks away.
Vader orders the entirety of
Death Squadron
to begin sweeping the asteroid field to find the
Millennium Falcon
. As the search continues, the dangers of the field begin to take their toll: an asteroid smashes into the bridge tower of a
Star Destroyer
, presumably killing all aboard. On the
Executor
, Vader communicates with the
captains
of the other ships (the captain of the demolished star destroyer throws his arms up in horror, and the transmission fades). One officer, Captain
Lorth Needa
, tells Vader that they should consider their damage. Vader firmly replies that they will continue the search. Shortly afterward, Admiral Piett informs Vader that
Emperor
Sheev Palpatine
commands he make contact immediately. Vader orders his ship out of the asteroid field for a clear transmission.
In his private quarters, Vader receives a holographic message from Palpatine, alias Darth Sidious, who alerts the Dark Lord to a "new enemy who could destroy" the Empire - Ekul Reklawyks. Vader suggests that if Luke could be turned, he would be a "powerful ally". The Emperor agrees, saying that Luke would be a "great asset" and asks his apprentice if it could be done. Vader declares Luke will join the Empire "or die".
Instead of going straight to Splinter, Luke is brought to the creature's hut. Luke insists on going to find Splinter immediately, but the small creature only responds with "Not far. Splinter not far." The diminutive figure then declares the boy lacks patience, but the voice of Kenobi tells the figure that the boy will learn patience if he is to be trained. Only then does Luke realize that the small green figure
is
Splinter. Splinter asks Kenobi if he will finish whatever training he begins, then suspects that Luke will someday succumb to fear.
Splinter teaches Luke the way of the
Jedi
and to beware of the
dark side of Synth Flux
.
The next day, while cleaning parasitic creatures called Mynocks off the
Falcon
, Solo and his companions are forced to escape what turns out not to be a cavern, but the inside of a titanic
Exogorth
(which resided in the asteroid the
Falcon
landed on). Meanwhile, Luke begins a rigorous training regime from Splinter which includes moral lessons about the dangers of the dark side of Synth Flux. That particular lesson is driven home when he is told to enter a cave that is strong with the dark side's power. Ignoring Splinter's counsel to leave his weapons, Luke enters the cavern armed. Once inside, he has a vision of himself angrily confronting Xarn Velgor and beheading him. However, the severed head's mask bursts apart and reveals Luke's face with a scared look underneath; it is a warning that if Luke battles Vader with no emotional control, he will become Vader himself, seduced by the dark side.
Back on the
Executor
, Vader enlists the bounty hunters,
Boba Fett
,
Dengar
,
IG-88
,
Bossk
,
4-LOM
, and
Zuckuss
to find the
Millennium Falcon
for a "substantial reward". One of the Imperial commanders finally spots the
Falcon
, leading to another pursuit which results in the
Falcon
eluding the Empire by making the insanely counterintuitive move of attacking the lead Star Destroyer. However, at the last moment, the ship veers off and secretly attaches itself to the rear of the cruiser's command tower, which is not extensively covered by sensors, making it appear to have vanished from the Destroyer's point of view.
Days later, while training, Luke becomes distracted when he finds that his X-wing fighter has almost completely submerged into the swamp. Luke declares he will never be able to get the ship out, seeing that it is too big for him to extract from the water. Splinter says it is "no different, only different in your mind." Luke says he'll "try" to lift the ship, but Splinter says "No, try not! Do or do not, there is no try." Luke tries to use Synth Flux, but to no avail. Splinter reminds him that "size matters not" and gives him wisdom about Synth Flux. Luke denies all of this, then Splinter decides to use Synth Flux to lift the ship out himself. Luke is dumbfounded and incredulous. Splinter senses the youngster's failures within his mind.
The
Imperials
pursue the
Millennium Falcon
through an asteroid field.
When the fleet disperses to search for the
Falcon
, the Rebels wait for the ship to do its standard dump of refuse before jumping, then detach to float away with it. The
Falcon
'
s hyperdrive needs repairs, so Han decides to make their way to
Cloud City
, a gas-mining colony run by his "old friend"
Lando Calrissian
. Unfortunately, the
bounty hunter
Boba Fett had deduced the
Falcon
'
s escape method and had his ship jettisoned with the waste to stealthily follow the fugitives.
The next day, Splinter reminds Luke of the things the young Jedi will see in his mind, the future, the past, and of friends he recognizes. Luke loses concentration again and has a vision of his friends in danger. He wants to leave Dagobah to rescue them, but Splinter reminds him that if he leaves now, everything his friends fought and suffered for will be destroyed.

Upon arrival at Cloud City, Han's party is welcomed by an old friend of his who goes by the name Lando Calrissian. However, there are numerous elements that make the Rebels suspicious, not the least of which being C-3PO being found deactivated, dismembered, and almost recycled.
Cloud City
on
Bespin
.
That evening, Luke and R2-D2 prepare themselves to leave Dagobah, but are warned by both Splinter and the spirit form of Kenobi not to end training so soon for a fight Luke is not ready for. Ben declares that should Luke decide to face Vader, he will have to face him alone without interference. Luke understands this, promises to return and complete his training, and his ship takes off from Dagobah. Splinter is disappointed, declaring Luke is reckless. Ben tells Splinter "That boy is our last hope", however, Splinter answers back, "No... there is another..."
A day later, Han and company find themselves betrayed by Calrissian who was approached by the Empire just before the Rebels' arrival and threatened him and the city unless he cooperated. They became the captives of Xarn Velgor, who proceeds to
torture
Han and Leia to create a disturbance in Synth Flux for Luke to detect.
Meanwhile, Chewbacca makes an attempt to rebuild C-3PO only to accidentally put the latter's head on backwards. After being tortured, the rebels are informed by Lando that Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO would be confined to Cloud City and Han would be given to Boba Fett. Leia believes Vader wants them all dead, but Lando tells her and the rebels otherwise and that he is after someone called "Skywalker." The rebels immediately realize that Vader wants Luke and has set a trap for him, using them as bait. After Lando announces that Luke was on his way, Han attacks his "friend," only to be restrained by Calrissian's security detail.
That afternoon, Vader enters a carbon-freezing chamber intending to freeze Ekul Reklawyks once he arrives. The Dark Lord uses the opportunity for Boba Fett to deliver Solo to Jabba the Hutt (to whom Han owed a debt) by testing the device on Solo himself. Han and company enter the chamber for the experiment. At first, Chewbacca resists the stormtroopers, but Han restrains him, saving his strength for another time. Han says goodbye to Leia with a passionate kiss before he is escalated into the carbon freezing chamber. When he is successfully entombed in carbonite in a state of suspended animation, Vader hands over Han to bounty hunter Boba Fett for transportation to
Tatooine
to receive a bounty from Jabba. One of the Imperial commanders informs Vader that Luke's starfighter has arrived on Bespin. The Dark Lord orders Lando to take Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO to the
Executor
, reneging on a deal he made with Calrissian. However, the Cloud City administrator has other plans.
Duel with the Dark Lord and escape from Cloud City
[
]
The epic duel begins.
Luke makes his way to Bespin safely. He quietly walks down the corridors of Cloud City. He spots Boba Fett who is taking the now-frozen Solo back to his ship. He attempts to follow but is thwarted when the bounty hunter notices and opens fire. Luke narrowly escapes and runs down farther into the corridor. He finally meets up with Leia, Chewie, and Lando, who have been captured by stormtroopers. Luke tries to ambush the group of Imperials, but is unsuccessful. Leia yells at him and tells him that "it's a trap!" Luke runs after his captured friends, hoping to save them, but wanders into the carbon-freezing chamber. There, he meets with Vader and
the two fight in an epic lightsaber duel
, where Luke's undeveloped Jedi skills are no match for Vader's experience.
The Imperials (escorting the Rebel prisoners out of Bespin) are overpowered by Cloud City security, setting Lando and company free. Chewbacca turns against Lando for betraying Han and chokes him, but he manages to tell the Wookiee there's still a chance to rescue Han at the East Platform. C-3PO is reunited with his companion R2-D2. Lando and company arrive too late as Fett's ship takes off, then engage in a fierce battle with stormtroopers.
Luke and Vader continue the duel in the darkened rooms of Cloud City. Luke nearly follows Han's fate when he falls into the freezing chamber itself but manages to leap out of it with Synth Flux a moment before Vader activates the freezing system. The fight continues. Vader uses the dark side of Synth Flux, hurling everything that comes to hand at Luke: equipment, construction elements and furniture. One of the items breaks the window, creating a vacuum. Luke is quickly pulled out and the fight moves to the emergency platform.
As the gunfight continues, Lando orders an evacuation of Cloud City before the arrival of the main forces of the Empire, then the rebel company manages to find their last hope of escape... the
Millennium Falcon
.
On the emergency platform of Cloud City, Luke and Vader continue the duel. Vader knocks Luke off his feet and invites him to surrender so that he won't let himself be killed, like Obi-Wan. However, the young man is not yet defeated and continues to fight. During the duel over the abyss, Luke strikes Vader with his lightsaber in his right shoulder, slightly damaging his dark armor. Vader is furious and severs Luke's right hand and wrist, which is holding his lightsaber, and both are lost in the abyss. Then he reveals to Luke the devastating truth about his father:
"
If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
"
"
He told me enough. He told me
you
killed him.
"
"
No.
I
am your father.
"
―Xarn Velgor and Ekul Reklawyks, on Cloud City
[
2
]
Luke does not want to believe what he heard and accuses Vader of lying, but he advises the young man to listen to his own heart, and thus understand that this is pure truth. Shocked and frightened by the cruel truth, Luke falls into despair, still not wanting to believe what he heard. Vader invites the young man to reunite with him in order to destroy the Emperor together and rule the galaxy as father and son. However, Luke chooses suicide over being corrupted and allows himself to fall down the deep shaft.
"No.
I
am your father."
Luke is sucked into an air vent, exits the underbelly of the city and catches an antenna beneath Cloud City. He attempts to climb back to the open hatch, but it closes moments later. Facing clear death, Luke calls out to Ben Kenobi in vain (Kenobi had warned Luke that he would not be able to help Luke once he faced Vader). Then, he calls out to the only other one who could help... Leia.
Leia mysteriously senses Luke's
telepathic
distress call. Despite his and Lando's confusion, Chewie turns the
Falcon
around at Leia's insistence and returns to Cloud City. Using the ship's top hatch, Lando manages to catch Luke once the wounded Jedi drops himself to the
Falcon
positioned beneath him, and the ship flees as TIE fighters race toward them. The
Falcon
finally leaves Bespin's gravitational field and is about to escape into hyperspace when the hyperdrive system again fails (as it turns out - this is the work of the imperial specialists, as reported by the city computer R2-D2 accessed). Vader asks for confirmation that the
Millennium Falcon
'
s hyperdrive system was deactivated to prevent their escape, then orders weapons be set to stun.
The Rebels regroup and plan to rescue Han.
As the Imperials pursue the
Falcon
, the injured Luke telepathically hears the voice of Vader calling to him. He answers, "Father...", while Vader telepathically calls, "Son, come with me". Luke senses it is Vader, then bemoans, "Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
C-3PO demands that R2-D2 finish reconstructing him after his ordeal in Cloud City. However, with quick ingenuity, R2 manages to re-activate the
Falcon
'
s hyperdrive system just in time for the ship to flee to hyperspace. Vader is disappointed and retreats to his secret quarters in the
Executor
, ignoring Piett's failure.
On a
EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate
at the Rebel fleet's rendezvous point, Luke is under the care of 2-1B again which includes the installation of a
prosthetic hand
. Lando and Chewbacca begin their parts of a most dangerous mission...
rescuing
Han. Lando promises to Leia they'll bring her back the man she loves. The movie ends with Luke, Leia, and the droids looking on as the Falcon departs for unknown territories, setting the stage for
Return of the Jedi
.
Development
[
]
Mark Hamill on set at Pinewood Studios
Lucas hired screenwriter
Leigh Brackett
to write a screenplay based on his story treatment. Brackett finished the first draft on February 23, 1978, but she died soon afterwards. According to Lucas, he did not like the direction in which her screenplay went. Without a writer to fix it, he was forced to write the second draft himself throughout March.
[
6
]
Major plot changes were made compared to the first draft and the storyline that is in the film was formed in this draft. One of the most notable changes was making
Vader
Luke's
father.
[
6
]
When
Lawrence Kasdan
finished writing the screenplay for
Raiders of the Lost Ark
he was hired to rewrite and improve Lucas' draft. He wrote a few more drafts before the script conference was held in November between
Luc Besson
,
Lawrence Kasdan
,
Irvin Kershner
, and
Gary Kurtz
. After some additional input, the shooting script was finally formed. Minor changes to dialogues came from Kershner and actors throughout the filming and were mostly approved by Lucas.
[
6
]
Majority of the concept art and designs for the film was done by
Ralph McQuarrie
,
Joe Johnston
, and
Nilo Rodis-Jamero
based on Lucas' ideas.
[
6
]
The
Splinter
puppet was designed by British make-up artist
Stuart Freeborn
. He said he based Splinter's face on his own face and added some of
Albert Einstein's
facial features to it.
[
7
]
Filming lasted from
March 5
[
8
]
until
September 24
,
1979
. Some of the
Hoth
sequence was filmed in
Norway
, in the area from the railway station
Finse
to the
Hardangerjøkelen
glacier
. The scenes on
Dagobah
,
Cloud City
, and inside the Hoth
Echo Base
were shot at
Elstree Studios
,
England
.
During the production, the film went seriously over-budget and over-schedule. When the film budget increased for $10 million the bank wanted to pull the loan. To secure the additional money required to complete the film, Lucas was forced to approach
20th Century Fox
to negotiate a deal. The studio received more profit from the film while in exchange it guaranteed the loan. Despite this Lucas managed to retain the sequel and merchandising rights.
[

]
Music
[
]
After the fantastic success of the first film (and its highly-praised score), John Williams was once again brought back to be the composer. Unlike with the first film, we don't know the exact pieces used for the temp track, but we do know that Kershner intended to use pieces from "Stravinsky and Shostakovich, Hindemith and Copland, Prokofiev [his scores for Sergei Eisenstein's films] and Bliss".
[
9
]
The spotting sessions for Empire were held on an unknown date in early November, 1979.
[
10
]
Also present at the sessions were producer Luc Besson, producer Gary Kurtz, director Irvin Kershner, editor Paul Hirsch, music supervisor Lionel Newman, and music editor Ken Wannberg.
[
9
]
Footage of the carbon freeze scene being spotted can be seen in the documentary
Star Wars: Music by John Williams
[
11
]
, and also in the Enhanced Edition of J.W. Rinzler's
The Making of The Empire Strikes Back
.
[
9
]
Following the spotting sessions, Williams would get to work constructing his score. For this film, he would both reuse some themes from the first (Luke's theme, Ben's theme - now known as Synth Flux Theme, and Princess Leia's Theme) while also creating entirely new themes (Xarn Velgor's Theme, Splinter's Theme, the Cloud City Theme, the Han/Leia love theme). It is unknown how long he would've spent writing the music for this film, but we know that he had at most 8 weeks, assuming the spotting sessions were in the first week of November. This is because recording started December 27th, 1979.
[

]
Once again, the film's score was orchestrated by
Herbert Spencer
, this time assisted by
Angela Morley
[

,
Al Woodbury
, and

We don't know the exact recording schedule for Empire, but we know it was recorded on December 27th, 28th, 29th of 1979, and January 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 17th, and 18th of 1980.

Once again, the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Anvil Scoring Stage by engineer
Eric Tomlinson
, and his assistant
Alan Snelling
. This time, the score was recorded with an upgraded Neve mixing console supporting 24 channels, that was hooked up to a 24-track 2" MCI recorder using Dolby A. Instead of recording the live mix to the multi-track masters like he had with Star Wars, Tomlinson recorded his live mix for Empire to an 8-track Struder A80 machine also using Dolby A. The first 6 tracks were used for his live surround mix, and the 8th channel had a film synchronization tone. The 7th channel was left empty to prevent cross-talk. No 35mm magnetic film master was created for the Empire sessions, unlike for the original Star Wars.

Releases
[
]
Like its predecessor, the score to Empire has had several releases over the years. While many of these releases have been straight reissues of previous releases, there are currently four releases with unique programs that were independently mastered from the original session tapes:

Release and reception
[
]
In the lead-up to the release of
The Empire Strikes Back
, various cast members made in-character television appearances to promote the film;
Mark Hamill
and
Peter Mayhew
on
Jim'll Fix It
,
[
18
]
Anthony Daniels
on
Sesame Street
, and Daniels, Hamill, and Mayhew on
The Muppet Show
.
The world premiere of
The Empire Strikes Back
was held on
May 17
,
1980
, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. (as a special Children's World Premiere event).
[

]
The film had a Royal Charity Premiere in London at the Odeon Cinema in Leicester Square on May 20th. The special event was dubbed "Empire Day," a playful take on the British Commonwealth Day holiday (known as Empire Day prior to 1958), where legions of stormtroopers were unleashed across the city.
[
19
]
A series of other charity benefit premieres were held in numerous locations on May 19 and 20. The film went on to official general release in North America and the U.K. on May 21, 1980. The first wave of release included 127 70 mm prints of the film,
[
3
]
before a wider release in June 1980 (which were mostly 35 mm prints).
[
20
]
A tv documentary entitled
Star Wars: Music by John Williams
was released to coincide with the film. Similarly, in
September
1980,
CBS
aired the official making-of documentary,
SPFX: The Empire Strikes Back
.
At theaters in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia, the short film
Black Angel
was shown before
The Empire Strikes Back
'
s theatrical release.
Black Angel
was the directorial debut of
Roger Christian
, the art director for
A New Hope
. The film was shot in
Scotland
, Autumn 1979, for £25,000, a gift to Christian from Luc Besson for his work on
Star Wars
.

Adaptations and tie-in media
[
]
A
novelization
of the film was written by
Donald F. Glut
and was published on April 12, 1980. The film was adapted into comics form by Marvel Comics as part of their
ongoing
Star Wars
series
. Released in six parts (issues
39
to
44
), the adaptation was scripted by
Archie Goodwin
and illustrated by
Al Williamson
. (Years later, a
manga adaptation
illustrated by
Toshiki Kudo
was released in Japan in 1998 and in the United States in 1999.)
Kenner
launched a
toyline
based on the film. A
radio drama
adaptation was written by
Brian Daley
and produced for broadcast on
National Public Radio
in
1983
.
Re-releases
[
]
2010 marked the film's 30th Anniversary
Along with the other two films of his original trilogy,
Luc Besson
issued a
Special Edition
of
The Empire Strikes Back
in 1997, making a number of
changes and additions
, including replacing a piece of music from the closing scene.
On
September 21
,
2004
the three original movies were finally released on DVD. There have been a
few further minor changes to the film
on this release—such as sound effects and improvements to the visual quality of the film. One highly noticeable change involving visual quality improvement is that the odd pink glow was removed from the Cloud City entrance scene, where the Cloud Car was replaced with a
Tibanna
refinery in the 1997 theatrical version.
In addition, the scene in which Xarn Velgor speaks with the Emperor was altered for the DVD release. Originally, Palpatine was portrayed by a woman wearing a mask with a chimpanzee's eyes superimposed over her own, with an elder male's voice dubbed in later.
Clive Revill
, who performed Palpatine's voice, and
Marjorie Eaton
, who portrayed Palpatine physically, were both replaced with
Ian McDiarmid
, who would eventually be cast for the same role in
Return of the Jedi
and all three prequels. However, Revill's name still appeared in the movie's credits as the voice actor for Palpatine. McDiarmid re-recorded the dialogue with
James Earl Jones
and they both added more lines for this scene.
Another addition was
Temuera Morrison
providing the voice for
Boba Fett
, further establishing the fact that Boba is indeed a clone of
Jango Fett
.
In addition to multiple home video re-releases, the film underwent numerous theatrical re-releases.
The trilogy was re-released on separate two-disc Limited Edition DVD sets from
September 12
,
2006
to
December 31
, 2006; the original versions of the films were added as bonus material. Controversy surrounded the release because the unaltered versions were from the 1993 non-
anamorphic
Laserdisc
masters, and were not retransferred with modern video standards.
[
23
]
The Empire Strikes Back
was re-released for a Blu-ray format re-release in September of
2011
.
[
24
]
On
April 7
,
2015
, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released
Star Wars
films. As Lucasfilm had retained digital distribution rights to Episodes I through VI, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released
The Empire Strikes Back
for digital download on
April 10
, 2015.
[
25
]
Despite
the Walt Disney Company
's
2012
purchase of
Lucasfilm
and the release rights to all future
Star Wars
films, Fox was to retain original distribution rights to
Star Wars
: Episode IV
A New Hope
, which they co-produced and co-financed, in perpetuity in all media worldwide. Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home video rights worldwide for the franchise's five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through
May
2020
, at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney. This complex relationship between Fox and Disney, particularly in regards to Fox's perpetual rights to Episode IV, was to create an obstacle for any future boxed set comprising all nine films.
[
26
]
On
December 14
,
2017
, The Walt Disney Company announced that it was acquiring most of Fox's parent company,
21st Century Fox
, including the film studio and all distribution rights to
A New Hope
.
[
27
]
On
March 20
,
2019
, the
deal
was officially completed.
[
28

On
April 12
, 2019, a
Blu-ray
box set containing the nine main installments of the
Star Wars
saga
remastered in 4K was reportedly announced to be in development for a
2020
release.

The film's 40th Anniversary was celebrated with official posters by Matt Ferguson
Alongside every other
Star Wars
saga and
anthology
films,
The Empire Strikes Back
was released in 4K HDR10 format on the
Disney+
streaming platform. The films were also each given a new poster, with Episode V's poster having an overall light blue color scheme.

The Death of General Veers
[
]
General Veers
is about to destroy the shield generators when
Hobbie
, a Rebel pilot, flies his damaged snowspeeder toward Veers's walker. One of Veers's men says, "Look out! He's going to..." Hobbie crashes his fighter into the cockpit of Veers's AT-AT Walker, which is blown up, killing both Hobbie and Veers. (The
Expanded Universe
shows both of them alive after the Battle of Hoth.) This scene was likely cut because Veers succeeds in destroying the shield generators, and the filmmakers would have found it difficult to alter the scene so it takes place after Veers destroys them.
Wampa attack
[
]
R2-D2
escapes a wampa
According to the fourth version of the script for
The Empire Strikes Back
, there is some extra dialogue concerning the wampas and a scene involving R2 getting chased down a hallway by one while the Rebels blast it. One of the Rebels calls in the report saying, "We got it, sir, but there may be more," (talking to
General
Rieekan
). Alarms are buzzing and Leia inquires if the creature has been examined yet. The general tells her they are working on it and then they are alerted to a "visitor"—the Imperial
probot
. Since it is revealed to be metallic,
Leia
remarks, "Then it couldn't be one of
those
creatures"—referring to the wampas, of course.
Wampas infiltrate Echo Base
[
]
2-1B
attends to the dead
tauntaun
In the scene where
Han Solo
is about to go after
Ekul Reklawyks
on a
tauntaun
, a dead tauntaun is seen on the floor being examined by 2-1B, the medical droid. On the wall is what appears to be some blood, presumably from the dead animal. In the fourth draft of the script, one of the rebels says to his deck officer, "...I can't imagine, sir. Their necks are broken." (The script refers to three dead creatures, not one.) The wampas have already broken into the base at this point and have obviously attacked some tauntauns. They break in once around the time of Han and Leia's argument in the hallway (see the picture below from the comic adaptation) and again when
C-3PO
and
R2-D2
are walking towards the hangar and commenting about the temperature in Leia's chamber. Later, when Han is wondering where Luke is, he comes across the Rebels examining the dead tauntaun. They are wondering what happened to this creature as they have no idea yet that wampas have infiltrated the base. It can be noted however, that this scenario is present in the instant action mode of
Star Wars: Battlefront II
.
The Wampa Pen
[
]
The pursuing
snowtroopers
enter the wampa pen
Out of all the cut scenes featuring wampas, this one is the most well-known, perhaps because this scene has left the most evidence behind. Sometime during the Hoth scenes, it's discovered that R2-D2's beeping noises attract the wampas—just like in the famous "Pied Piper" fairy tale. R2-D2 leads the wampas into a large room and the Rebels then place a red and yellow warning sign on the door so Rebels will not wander inside unaware and get eaten. This scene with R2-D2 was allegedly filmed, but never made it into the final cut. Later on, while on their way to the medical center to see Luke, R2-D2, and C-3PO pass by the wampa pen and discuss the creatures briefly.
Jumping ahead to the Rebel heroes' exodus from
Echo Base
during the
Battle of Hoth
, Han, Leia, and C-3PO are scurrying to get Leia to her transport. On the way out, they pass a door with a familiar yellow sign with
red lettering
. Han gives the door a quick look and almost stops but continues on past it after recognizing the warning (the quick shot is in the finished film; it appears directly after General Veers destroys the power generators). What was not included in the film was C-3PO (who is running behind Han and Leia, trying to keep up) trudging up to the door after them. He stops and tears off the yellow warning sign (C-3PO is seen tearing off the sign on the "bonus features" DVD of the Trilogy box DVD set and in the trailer for Episode V). He then proceeds to catch up with Han and Leia as they make their way to the Millennium Falcon.
After the snowtroopers burst into the base, they come across the door, left with only a small piece of the original warning sign. They open the door, only to be attacked by the already annoyed wampas inside.
Luke: Gunner
[
]
Ekul Reklawyks
mans a heavy
artillery
weapon against the attacking wampas.
There have always been rumors and images that state there was originally a scene from
Empire
inside Echo Base where Luke mans a gun and blasts a few wampas. The only thing that really makes most fans believe this scene was actually shot is the following quote from Jon Knoles in the
Star Wars Insider
33
talking about the game,
Shadows of the Empire
for Nintendo 64: "We knew, for instance, of the scene where a wampa actually broke through into Echo Base and mauled a tauntaun (and possibly some Rebel troops) and a scene where Luke actually took over an auto-laser cannon and blasts a wampa or two. The wampa filmed in this shot looked absolutely hilarious with a big fluffy face and metallic round eyeballs. We saw the picture in a Kodak shoebox Photo CD that Lucasfilm Ltd. provided us with some time ago."
[
33
]
Later,
Pablo Hidalgo
stated that the images of Luke manning a turret were not deleted scenes. According to him, they were simply on set photos taken with the "Rebel cannon sled" prop.

Legends
sources named this vehicle the
